The XR Wordsmiths Solarpunk Storytelling Showcase is Extinction Rebellion’s first global short story contest for all ages.

The project rides the wave of the Solarpunk movement and aims to use the power of collective imagination as a tool against the climate and ecological emergency. Through radical re-imaginings of the world, we can get closer to creating a future that is positive and healthy for all life.

2021’s Showcase was this project’s first iteration. The idea was seeded by activists Lottie Emily Dodd and Alex Dickinson and given wings by XR Wordsmiths, with Lottie steering the way. The winning entries were announced in December 2021 after being selected by a diverse panel of judges including eco-authors, scientists, teachers, and a UK Green Party politician. 

This website was built by Theresa Merchant and Tega Brain of [Solar Protocol](SolarProtocol.net) using solar-powered servers.
