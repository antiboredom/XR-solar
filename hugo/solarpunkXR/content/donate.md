The 2021 Solarpunk Storytelling Showcase was only made possible through the incredible hard work and generosity of everyone involved: judges, illustrators, graphic designers, web developers, prize donors - the list goes on.

We were amazed to see how far this project went without any official fundraising, and are excited to see how much bigger and better it can get in later iterations. As such, we have set up a [Just Giving Page](https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/solarpunk-storytelling-showcase?utm_term=KRE6nnM3b) where you can donate to help fund the next Showcase - any amount appreciated and welcome!
