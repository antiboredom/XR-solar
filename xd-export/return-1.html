            Only the cold, untwinkling speck of a space station pierced the darkness between the thinning<br />cumulus
            and the churning ink black sea.<br />The storm sail billowed and creaked, water thundered like rapids
            between the three hulls, and<br />Kraken hydrofoiled a metre clear of the water, slicing through the
            detritus of coconuts and<br />disintegrating plastic that had been whipped into a seething broth by the
            Pacific cyclone wind.<br />My eyes combed the ebony veils for signs of pursuit, but the outcasts’ ramshackle
            vessel couldn’t<br />have made it through. We sailed alone once more.<br />“Argo, thanks for keeping us
            safe”. I finally breathed, with relief.<br />“That is my primary function, and what the storm-runner models
            were designed for, Captain” the<br />ship’s computer replied in calculated soothing tones.<br />“Did you
            notify the GOPs yet?”.<br />“The Global Ocean Protectorate has been informed of the presence of pirates”.<br />“Genius!
            So glad I paid extra for the deluxe system”.<br />“Actually, you just received another message from
            CircularSeas regarding arrears in rental<br />payments. I have reviewed the accounts. May I suggest that you
            cease accepting rum and<br />strawberries as payment?”<br />“Well, you may suggest that. But who would turn
            down a strawberry daiquiri after six months of<br />desalinated water?”<br />“I would” he replied flatly.<br />“Okay.
            But it also doesn’t help that noone ever wants to visit Kiribati. I guess after the nuclear<br />testing it
            just never made it onto the tourist map…” My thoughts drifted into uncertain waters.<br />“Despite my
            superior programming, human behavior remains a mystery to me. Why are we heading<br />for Tarawa Atoll?”.<br />My
            mind whirled, directionless, like a coconut in the cyclone, hoping one day to rest on solid<br />ground.<br />“I
            just wanted to make sure it was still there…”.<br />The hatch snapped open. It was my mother, Calista.<br />I
            always took the nightwatch. It gave me time away from Calista, who had traded in her small blue<br />algae
            business to buy a new pair of ‘dancing knees’ and pay the deposit and first months’ rent on<br />Kraken as
            my Ocean Guardian graduation present. Turned out she couldn’t afford the retirement<br />eco-cruiseship. So
            the day I set sail on my first trade run she showed up at the dock wearing an<br />enormous floppy straw
            hat, carrying four suitcases of mumu dungarees and a micro farming kit,<br />accompanied by Lorenzo, I think
            his name was, waving and shouting “surprise! We’re your first<br />passengers!”. It was a fine day for
            sailing, and the impractical hat barely made it out of Portsmouth<br />harbour. Likewise Lorenzo, who
            disappeared not long after.<br />“Genevieve! Have you seen the bioluminescence? It’s simply divine” cooed
            Calista. “Did you log<br />the sighting yet or shall I?”.<br />“It’s all yours” I replied.<br />Don’t get me
            wrong, I was glad to have my mother aboard. She was an expert at recruiting<br />passengers, and had a
            rather magical way of making Perfect Protein taste like it wasn’t made in a<br />test tube.<br />“I couldn’t
            sleep through that tempest! But thank Gaia, the stars are coming out again now… Did I<br />ever tell you
            that when I was a girl growing up in London I never saw the stars. Even after your<br /><br />grandparents
            fought to get the ecocide laws introduced in the 20s, it took another 10 years or more<br />to clear the
            smog.”<br />“Yes, you did, Cali”. I wasn’t tired of her stories, they gave me perspective.<br />There was a
            thrumming and wailing that sounded like mermaids performing opera inside a tidal<br />power installation.
            Some 30m off the starboard bow the surface of the water was rippling with<br />mechanical strokes, and there
            following close behind, framed in the moonlight, were the finned<br />arches of three whales.<br />“Imagine
            if it were a family of blue whales and a pod of common dolphins” I dreamed aloud.<br />“Well” my mother
            considered. “Maybe one day the rewilding trials will succeed. Whilst there’s<br />frozen genetic material,
            we have hope.” A note of sadness briefly tainted her voice. “I’ll log the<br />sighting. Would you say that
            was two adult humpbacks and a calf following the seasweeps?”.<br />“I think so”. I agreed. “Humpbacks seem
            to love the plankton and clean water the sweeps spit out”.<br />“Do you know a humpback mother whale
            produces around 500 litres of milk a day? She’s the super<br />Mama” she mused, wistfully. “I still remember
            breastfeeding you… You used to bite!”<br />“You know I’m 42 years old?!”<br />“Yes. And I will always be
            your mother, even if you refuse to call me Mum since we moved onto<br />this boat.” She hesitated, and then
            it came spilling out. “So… Do you ever think about having<br />children?”<br />“Not anytime soon! Besides, I
            don’t think it’s safe having a baby aboard”. I found myself oddly<br />defensive. She’d never asked me that
            before.<br />“We can make it safe” she reassured. “ And I could do all the baby sitting. It wouldn’t make
            much<br />difference, you never sleep at night anyway”.<br />“Cali, your idea of safe is renting a shoreline
            house because it’s cheap and picturesque and then it’s<br />washed away in the first storm… Your idea of
            safe is holding a cocktail party during a wet bulb<br />event that killed 40,000 people… Your idea of safe
            is encouraging Dad to lead an antinuclear<br />protest at a power plant defended by the Privs’ militia…!”<br />As
            I spat out this last drop of venom I didn’t know I’d been storing, I realised I’d gone too far.<br />“The
            cocktails were medicinal, alcohol free, and we didn’t know the wet bulb was coming. No one<br />did…”
            Calista began to object.<br />“I’m sorry, mum. All I meant to say is that there is nowhere safe. It’s like
            you always said, ‘nature<br />shows no mercy’”.<br />Tears glistened on Calista’s aging, high cheekbones as
            she turned away wounded, and fearing I may<br />be right. I stared on, out to sea, wishing for all the rum
            and strawberries in the world that I was<br />wrong.<br />The whale song reached a crescendo of desperate
            melancholy, as five tall ebony blades rose slowly<br />out of the water like tombstones. A family of killer
            whales were on the hunt.<br />Far ahead, a line of lights faintly shimmered across the brightening horizon,
            which meant that<br />Tarawa Atoll, at least, had weathered another year of storms.<br />We followed the
            seasweeps in towards one of the decommissioned oil rigs that circled the atoll.<br />Seaweed crops covered
            the supports like the shaggy legs of a gargantuan woolly mammoth, and the<br />rig platforms swarmed with
            figures in overalls processing plastic back into black gold.<br />The island’s mangroves blazed a fierce
            green, ignited by the rising sun. They bathed their buttress<br />roots like a crowd of toddlers in the
            shallow turquoise waters, binding sand to rock, whilst the<br />Mother tree stood proud and tall, guarding
            the fragile earthen heart of the atoll.<br />Making for land, I dropped the black solar sails and folded the
            floats in a vain attempt to sneak past<br />the vine tangled dome of a WW2 gun that took aim at approaching
            ships.<br />Betio harbour was bustling with industry much like any other I’d been to, only in a
            particularly<br />organised manner. Calista checked her blue and white highlighted hair, before hopping
            lightly onto<br />the dock. In a swish of patched, tie-dyed hemp and big sunglasses she was off into the
            throng with<br />her merchandise bag, like a teenager on a field trip.<br />“Cali!” I called after her. “No
            more payment in soft fruits!”.<br /><br />“Ok dear. I’ll be back by 6pm local time. I have a virtual therapy
            session I don’t want to miss”.<br />“Is that you giving the therapy, or receiving?”<br />She winked
            mischievously “I think a bit of both”.<br />My tiredness had reached a level that sleep couldn’t fix, at
            least not until I’d taken a dip to clear my<br />head. I grabbed a swimsuit and ran to catch the beach
            before the flotsam of the cyclone made<br />landfall.<br />Little had changed since I was last in Tarawa,
            save for the trees growing taller, and a few more rigs.<br />But here and there I passed storm scars; a
            swathe of mangrove trees blown down, a houseraft run<br />aground, and everywhere people working hard to
            repair them. It seemed to me like the island’s<br />strength was not in its foundations of shifting sands,
            but in the communities that were holding it<br />together.<br />I stopped at a bathing pool by a honeycomb
            of floating houses, each with a roof garden and a<br />pontoon for tying up canoes.<br />I knew this spot
            well enough to dive in without looking. Pausing a moment to breathe in the<br />memories, I leaped and dived
            down, deep into the water, not caring in that reckless moment how far<br />from safety I may have
            strayed.<br />Suddenly something strong and smooth wrapped around my ankle and pulled me down. Thrashing<br />and
            kicking the thing away, in that blurry blue world I saw the tattooed legs and flippers disappear<br />in a
            burst of bubbles. Reaching the surface I gasped for air and faced my assailant. My fear-driven<br />anger
            melted away to slackjawed surprise.<br />It was Timon.<br />“Crocodile!” he shouted with a smile that
            extended wider than his face.<br />He circled me, his hands tracing the flock of swallows that extended from
            my right elbow to<br />between my shoulder blades. One bird for every 40,000 nautical miles. I was planning
            for them to<br />reach the other elbow, but plans could always be changed.<br />“How are you Gen? I see
            you’ve added a few more birds to the flock. You know swimming here<br />you have to watch out for sea
            kraits. Those snakes have gone crazy since the reef transplant.<br />They’re mainly a problem on land
            though. Don’t worry, I’ll go shake your clothes out for you.”<br />I followed him out of the water. As he
            pulled on a shirt, leaving it open at the front I noticed he’d<br />gained a new tattoo. It sat awkwardly, I
            thought, above the traditionally inked zigzag lines on his<br />torso; a desert island with two palm trees
            in garish bright colours, as if the island were levitating<br />over waves.<br />“I’m ok” I managed to
            reply. “Same old sea, passengers, cargo, Calista… And you? How is life in<br />Kiribati?”<br />“Life here is
            good and even better for seeing you.” He said, shooting me another warming smile.<br />“We’ve had some bad
            storms the last two years and had to dredge and rebuild three islands. One of<br />them was the
            Sponsor’s.”<br />“And they rebuilt his island first, right?”<br />“No, as a matter of fact she insisted we
            work on the other islands first”.<br />“Intriguing” I said. “Perhaps you could tell me about it over a
            drink?”.<br />Walking down the steps into the subterranean shade of the Bunker Bar, my eyes took a while
            to<br />adjust. The air was warm and musty with the scent of sweat and seafood.<br />Timon was talking
            animatedly, plucking ideas out of the air and gripping them between his hands.<br />The seawall project had
            expanded under new funding, he had been elected onto the council, and one<br />day he hoped to run for
            president.<br />We found a seat and ordered.<br />“Enough of politics. Tarawa is self-sufficient, but what
            happens to you at the next food shortage?”.<br />“Oh, we’re ok, what with mum’s microfarm and we’re now
            dabbling in mycology”.<br />“And insects?” he suggested, raising an eyebrow.<br /><br />“Not yet! Though it
            beats me why eating mold is somehow more civilized than bugs. No, honestly,<br />we’re just one duck short
            of self-sufficiency”.<br />“That can be arranged” Timon laughed and slapped my arm. “Now I have a small
            favour to ask. A<br />boat of kids was picked up by a windjammer cruiseship a few weeks ago. Turns out the
            Marshall<br />Islands had a school washed away... I was wondering if you could take them home?”.<br />“Timon,
            I’d love to, but right now I can’t even pay my rent”.<br />“It sounds like you need a Sponsor!” Timon always
            had a solution.<br />“I’m sorry but I can’t take handouts from a Priv”.<br />“Privilege isn’t a bad thing if
            it’s used to do good. I should know, I’m engaged to a ‘Priv’! Honestly,<br />I think you’d like her”.<br />At
            these words I felt my heart burst open and flood upwards, choking in my throat.<br />“Actually I think you
            went freediving with her the last time you were here.” He added.<br />“Hang on... There’s no way Nauri is a
            Priv!”.<br />“Her father died two years ago, and it turns out he was very rich. Anyway, I have to run now. I
            have<br />a Council meeting. No more living on ‘island time’ I’m afraid”.<br />He stood up to leave and
            fixed me with his kind, dark eyes. “Like I said, I know a good Sponsor”.<br />I struggled to speak with so
            much bitterness to swallow.<br />“Well, I bet she doesn’t have an engagement tattoo across the middle of her
            chest.” I blurted out.<br />“No, she doesn’t...” He admitted, his lips curling, suppressing a thought. Then
            he leant in to<br />whisper “hers is somewhere else...”.<br />I watched him skip up the steps where the
            blinding sunlight was streaming in. It illuminated a<br />miniature Milky Way of dust that drifted slowly
            down to impact soundlessly on the sandy floor.<br />Then the young waiter arrived at the table with a plate
            of farmed tiger prawns. My mouth watered,<br />but what I wanted wasn’t on the menu. I sent it to the
            plastic harvester sat nearby, still in her<br />overalls, bags under her eyes as dark as the night she’d
            been working through.<br />“Get her a drink as well” I added as I pressed a bag of coffee beans into his
            hand and two stainless<br />steel teaspoons I’d dived from a wreck. He looked at me confused. “They can be
            melted down” I<br />explained, before heading out into the unforgiving midday sun.<br />The third day dawned
            calm and bright, and fair winds beckoned. Timon and Nauri had been in more<br />meetings but sent their
            regards.<br />“Welcome aboard...” I faltered in front of my blank-faced passengers, wondering if they were
            any<br />good at poker. “Please don’t touch any buttons”.<br />I paused again, trapped in the gaze of a
            dozen pairs of wide eyes, and a malevolent looking duck<br />whom I later named Lorenza.<br />“Oh, and
            especially don’t flush the toilet near land because it converts our waste into sea fertilizer,<br />simulating
            the flocculant of a blue whale.”<br />Eleven confused faces turned towards the tallest boy. “What she means
            is if you press this button<br />the boat will poo like a big fish”.<br />The eruption of laughter startled
            Lorenza, who flapped about and ejected her own fertilizer across<br />the deck, sending the kids hopping and
            shrieking after it.<br />“Calista, no more payments in water fowl”.<br />My mum laughed then too, tears
            glistening on her high cheekbones, and it reminded me that having<br />children aboard really wasn’t safe.
            But then again, nowhere ever was.<br /><br />The small bookshop Taylor owned was closed, its solar lamp
            flicked pointedly off, but after several minutes of persistent knocking there was a loud squawk, and his
            co-owner Sam came to the door with a resigned sigh. “You didn’t have to wake up Darwin,” he muttered
            irritably, brightening a bit when he saw the albatross. Darwin, one of Crate’s few dodos, eyed her
            curiously, his collar jingling as he fluttered onto the coffee table to get a better look at the drone’s
            dissection.<br /><br />#<br /><br />“It’s not a net drone, oddly, though it looks like one,” Sam said at
            last, surveying the scraps. “It’s automata – back before the pureclones, some people tried to bring back
            extinct species through robot facsimiles. The rubberized vaquita were cute – not as realistic as the gen-mod
            versions, of course. But cute.” <br /><br />A jealous beak jostled the table, and Sam reached down to stroke
            Darwin behind his collar. “You’re several strains away from a pureclone, beastie. More pigeon than
            anything,” he muttered, and Darwin puffed his chest feathers with pride before strutting into the kitchen to
            beg another piece of hydroponic seaweed.<br /><br />“If it’s not a net drone, why is it set up like one?”
            Akila asked slowly. <br /><br />Sam’s brow furrowed with a fear she could not place, but he said
            nothing. <br /><br />#<br /><br />Sam suspected that the drone was American in origin, and had veered wildly
            off course after a particularly gnarly hurricane that had flooded much of what remained of Florida. America
            was one of the few countries that still used the old automata builds, he knew from Taylor’s halcyon stories
            of the dog automata of his youth. Taylor always spoke of America fondly. It was as though he remembered only
            the cotton candy of his childhood 4th of July parades, and not the black-clad Vice police, the militarized
            crackdown against “riot boosting.” How each new storm was twisted into the wrath of an angry god, the way
            fear of the rising seas crept up from news chyrons to a choking, ever-present panic. As fires winked red
            eyes across the Western skies, strong men leaders rose like sea walls, promising to protect their flock from
            a new plague. Those who pushed back – who resisted the rush to blame – became blasphemous. <br /><br />The
            economic aftershocks of the collapse of offshore oil – propped up heavily with subsidies – had been the
            first blow. Then, Mexico pulled out of the lucrative trade pacts that had kept drone-retailers headquartered
            in America’s port cities. Much of Silicon Valley, frustrated also by the new taxes on online transactions
            and so-called cultural purity standards for Internet fast lanes, moved offshore, settling into the new stilt
            cities of Southeast Asia and, eventually, floating cities like Crate as sea levels kept rising. <br /><br />Driverless
            transport, once a novelty, had become the backbone of Mexico’s coastal economy, leaving its northern
            neighbor crumbling. And, as the unmanned barges and trucks and trains hummed silently across the globe,
            lonely Crate, once barely a speck of rust in the Indian Ocean, grew into an unlikely metropolis, a jostling
            and jovial mix of devout Sikhs and stateless Deists, Hindu refugees and renegade hipsters. Some, like
            Akila’s parents, were engineers who emigrated to tinker with the drone-barges that stopped by Crate for
            repairs, while others, like Taylor, had escaped the purges of President Cloud, <br /><br />“It was like the
            wild west in the early days,” Taylor said absently. “When I first came, I was writing a story speculating on
            whether Crate would become one of those walled cities, a floating theocracy where nothing ever came in, and
            nothing ever went out. It was a pendulum back then, before Mayor Fawzia, and a slight push in either
            direction –”<br /><br />“Ironically, America went isolationist first.” Sam sank into the couch beside his
            husband, leaning his head onto his shoulder. “Keep Crate weird, wasn’t that our slogan in the early days? It
            seems so long ago…” There was a long silence, broken only by a hydroponic hum, a fluorescent flickering as
            the solar lamps sputtered to life, and the city settled into twilight. <br /><br />Akila had interned for
            Mayor Fawzia one summer, and she remembered the elderly Eritrean woman well, famed as she was for her fiery
            defense of citizenship for the stateless and the Albatross Autonomous Internet, the clamor against
            censorship that had come to define Crate’s destiny. Unlike the walled cities, Crate had turned outwards,
            embracing the castaways who clung to its churning wave energy converters and fashioned its first storm
            barriers out of plastic and broken bottles. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch and other offshore landfills had
            rapidly been subsumed in the desperate days when the floating cities were little more than rafts of tents,
            refugee camps forged by desperation. After decades of tense negotiation, the world’s superpowers at last
            proved unwilling to take in the millions who had relied on bleaching coral archipelagos. Instead, they set
            up the primitive hydrofreight refugee system as a compromise, and sent the starving out to sea with a few
            scattered packets of gen-mod seaweed.<br /><br />Almost at once, tinkerers from around the world had begun
            prodding these curious patches of floating misery. From well-wishers around the world, in packages of every
            shape and size, came solar batteries and hydroponic waste treatment and algae generators and pieces of the
            first-generation storm stabilization systems, the ballasts and spherical barrier walls that had steadied
            Crate through many a tropical typhoon. Most of the heavy lifting was done by the residents themselves -
            refugees who forged a floating city where everyone knew every job and everyone. In the first few
            generations, fixing the barrier shields was done by hand, not by drone, and there was a monument on almost
            every street corner to those who had been lost in the perpetual struggle against the sea. Crate had been
            forced to flounder along on the revenue from seaweed farming for over a decade before finally settling into
            a steady suburban hum, a comfortable carpet of coffee shops and cloning start-ups. These far-flung gen-mod
            firms had later produced pigeon monstrosities like Darwin, who was currently hopping to and fro, sputtering
            indignantly at not being allowed on the couch.<br /><br />Taylor patted him absently, and Darwin cooed,
            momentarily soothed. “At least the pureclones are friendly,” he muttered. “That – that thing on the table is
            not.” Sam shot him a glance.<br /><br />“Should we tell her?”<br /><br />Taylor sighed, settling back to
            stroke Darwin’s feathers. Within a few minutes the dodo was snoring on the rug.<br /><br />“After the Third
            American Exclusion Act, President Cloud started a new crackdown. What you found was a propaganda drone – an
            ancient model, a bit like the net drones social networks used to send out in the old days, before the
            low-orbit satellites made that largely obsolete. Your bird here would have circled the states for thousands
            of miles without stopping, re-routing any signal it came in contact with.”<br /><br />“A very old femtocell
            hack,” Sam said softly. “Not perfect, but fairly unpredictable, and if you get caught with something you
            shouldn’t…” Taylor shuddered. <br /><br />“So it’s the opposite of our albatrosses? Fawzia’s Autonomous
            Internet?” Akila felt a warm sliver of indignation prickle across her chest. <br /><br />Sam chuckled.
            “Technically, I think it’s supposed to be a bald eagle, but the paint wore off. Not much we can do, I’m
            afraid. If we fix the nav system, it might make it home. Otherwise, it’ll just make it to my scrap drawer. I
            might just build a new dodo to replace this one.” He nudged Darwin gently with one foot, and Darwin stirred
            in his sleep and rolled over, scaly feet clasped peacefully across his bulbous belly. <br /><br />Taylor
            chuckled. “Let’s talk about something more pleasant. Tea?”<br /><br /> After a few more pleasantries, Akila
            stumbled out into the twilight, shivering as a fine mist drifted down from the barrier hull far above. A low
            growl echoed through the deserted streets as the barrier hulls tightened, the rings of metal curling like
            petals around the slumbering city after the sun went down. Drifting just east of Madagascar, President Cloud
            and his albatross seemed a world away.<br /><br />#<br /><br />For the next week the albatross circled
            ceaselessly through her thoughts, until at last Akila burst through the shop door, her face flushed,
            startling Sam and frightening Darwin. <br /><br />“The campaign against Pinochet!” she gasped at last.
            Darwin cooed quizzically. “Cloud’s platform is all about fear, right? So you counter it with something
            saccharine, something fluffy and upbeat. Something the censors won’t expect.”<br /><br />“The opposition
            can’t run ads, it isn’t allowed,” Taylor said tersely.<br /><br />Akila sighed, exasperated. “You always say
            politics is a pendulum. So why not try to push it? Why not give the states a real choice for once?”<br /><br />“I
            did try to push it, and it pushed me here,” Taylor snapped. “At least Cloud has one less drone now. What do
            you expect me to do?”<br /><br /> “Why not start with fixing the nav system?”<br /><br />#<br /><br />On the
            eve of the American election, the New Unity Party were facing down the American Lions, President Cloud’s
            party, and, as always, the Green Party, proudly clinging to 5.4% of the electorate. The Lions had long since
            switched to an online voting system, eliminating the former certification process - and a healthy swath of
            voter registrations - to ensure their continued limp to victory.  <br /><br />At 8 p.m. sharp, President
            Cloud’s face flickered across every watch, display, and e-mug in America, promising a golden dawn of
            prosperity. And at 8:04 p.m. an undead albatross plunged into the heart of the Vice Ministry’s media hub, a
            targeted strike on the one zotta-processor through which all communications were routed.<br /><br />The
            video they had chosen was more medley than montage, a slip-shod history that President Cloud denied existed.
            Flappers frolicked on Rockaway Beach before the New Jersey offshore drilling operation collapsed. Ticker
            tape fluttered through Times Square on V-Day, and piles of bananas and papayas glistened in supermarkets
            before the Tropical Fruit Embargo of 2025.  Bayard Rustin mapped out the March on Washington, fading into
            other marches, other speeches, a flipbook of all the pages the Vice Ministry had torn out of textbooks.
            Akila watched with bated breath as the first net drones went up, and Dorothy Vaughn smiled in crisp black
            and white. The U.N. Secretary General announced the creation of the hydrofreights. <br /><br />The video
            sped up, flipping faster and faster from present to past. In the dizzying collage of photos and clippings
            was the full Fibonacci tree of futures, the endless branchings and re-branchings that led, however
            improbably, to President Cloud, to Crate, to a world of walls and albatrosses. She saw the floating cities
            built from scrap, the desperate scrabble for life as superpowers turned inwards. She saw two paths,
            spiraling out from one other, a world spread like a spider web across the sea, a state governed by the
            stateless, and a feudal, frightened world, circling ever inwards. She saw the end of history, and a choice
            in how it would end.<br /><br />The first clusters of no votes appeared, glittering like stars,
            constellations that spun outward from a half dozen cities. The pendulum trembled, then began to tilt. The
            projection shivered, and when the image came back whole swathes of the map gleamed silver. <br /><br />“Even
            if Cloud doesn’t concede they’ll know,” Sam said softly. “They see it now, even if they didn’t before.”<br /><br />Shortly
            before midnight, the New Unity Party began lifting the censorship standards. And, ten thousand miles away,
            Fawzia’s albatrosses flew west on silent silver wings, bringing good luck for a new century.

            Only the cold, untwinkling speck of a space station pierced the darkness between the thinning<br />cumulus
            and the churning ink black sea.<br />The storm sail billowed and creaked, water thundered like rapids
            between the three hulls, and<br />Kraken hydrofoiled a metre clear of the water, slicing through the
            detritus of coconuts and<br />disintegrating plastic that had been whipped into a seething broth by the
            Pacific cyclone wind.<br />My eyes combed the ebony veils for signs of pursuit, but the outcasts’ ramshackle
            vessel couldn’t<br />have made it through. We sailed alone once more.<br />“Argo, thanks for keeping us
            safe”. I finally breathed, with relief.<br />“That is my primary function, and what the storm-runner models
            were designed for, Captain” the<br />ship’s computer replied in calculated soothing tones.<br />“Did you
            notify the GOPs yet?”.<br />“The Global Ocean Protectorate has been informed of the presence of pirates”.<br />“Genius!
            So glad I paid extra for the deluxe system”.<br />“Actually, you just received another message from
            CircularSeas regarding arrears in rental<br />payments. I have reviewed the accounts. May I suggest that you
            cease accepting rum and<br />strawberries as payment?”<br />“Well, you may suggest that. But who would turn
            down a strawberry daiquiri after six months of<br />desalinated water?”<br />“I would” he replied flatly.<br />“Okay.
            But it also doesn’t help that noone ever wants to visit Kiribati. I guess after the nuclear<br />testing it
            just never made it onto the tourist map…” My thoughts drifted into uncertain waters.<br />“Despite my
            superior programming, human behavior remains a mystery to me. Why are we heading<br />for Tarawa Atoll?”.<br />My
            mind whirled, directionless, like a coconut in the cyclone, hoping one day to rest on solid<br />ground.<br />“I
            just wanted to make sure it was still there…”.<br />The hatch snapped open. It was my mother, Calista.<br />I
            always took the nightwatch. It gave me time away from Calista, who had traded in her small blue<br />algae
            business to buy a new pair of ‘dancing knees’ and pay the deposit and first months’ rent on<br />Kraken as
            my Ocean Guardian graduation present. Turned out she couldn’t afford the retirement<br />eco-cruiseship. So
            the day I set sail on my first trade run she showed up at the dock wearing an<br />enormous floppy straw
            hat, carrying four suitcases of mumu dungarees and a micro farming kit,<br />accompanied by Lorenzo, I think
            his name was, waving and shouting “surprise! We’re your first<br />passengers!”. It was a fine day for
            sailing, and the impractical hat barely made it out of Portsmouth<br />harbour. Likewise Lorenzo, who
            disappeared not long after.<br />“Genevieve! Have you seen the bioluminescence? It’s simply divine” cooed
            Calista. “Did you log<br />the sighting yet or shall I?”.<br />“It’s all yours” I replied.<br />Don’t get me
            wrong, I was glad to have my mother aboard. She was an expert at recruiting<br />passengers, and had a
            rather magical way of making Perfect Protein taste like it wasn’t made in a<br />test tube.<br />“I couldn’t
            sleep through that tempest! But thank Gaia, the stars are coming out again now… Did I<br />ever tell you
            that when I was a girl growing up in London I never saw the stars. Even after your<br /><br />grandparents
            fought to get the ecocide laws introduced in the 20s, it took another 10 years or more<br />to clear the
            smog.”<br />“Yes, you did, Cali”. I wasn’t tired of her stories, they gave me perspective.<br />There was a
            thrumming and wailing that sounded like mermaids performing opera inside a tidal<br />power installation.
            Some 30m off the starboard bow the surface of the water was rippling with<br />mechanical strokes, and there
            following close behind, framed in the moonlight, were the finned<br />arches of three whales.<br />“Imagine
            if it were a family of blue whales and a pod of common dolphins” I dreamed aloud.<br />“Well” my mother
            considered. “Maybe one day the rewilding trials will succeed. Whilst there’s<br />frozen genetic material,
            we have hope.” A note of sadness briefly tainted her voice. “I’ll log the<br />sighting. Would you say that
            was two adult humpbacks and a calf following the seasweeps?”.<br />“I think so”. I agreed. “Humpbacks seem
            to love the plankton and clean water the sweeps spit out”.<br />“Do you know a humpback mother whale
            produces around 500 litres of milk a day? She’s the super<br />Mama” she mused, wistfully. “I still remember
            breastfeeding you… You used to bite!”<br />“You know I’m 42 years old?!”<br />“Yes. And I will always be
            your mother, even if you refuse to call me Mum since we moved onto<br />this boat.” She hesitated, and then
            it came spilling out. “So… Do you ever think about having<br />children?”<br />“Not anytime soon! Besides, I
            don’t think it’s safe having a baby aboard”. I found myself oddly<br />defensive. She’d never asked me that
            before.<br />“We can make it safe” she reassured. “ And I could do all the baby sitting. It wouldn’t make
            much<br />difference, you never sleep at night anyway”.<br />“Cali, your idea of safe is renting a shoreline
            house because it’s cheap and picturesque and then it’s<br />washed away in the first storm… Your idea of
            safe is holding a cocktail party during a wet bulb<br />event that killed 40,000 people… Your idea of safe
            is encouraging Dad to lead an antinuclear<br />protest at a power plant defended by the Privs’ militia…!”<br />As
            I spat out this last drop of venom I didn’t know I’d been storing, I realised I’d gone too far.<br />“The
            cocktails were medicinal, alcohol free, and we didn’t know the wet bulb was coming. No one<br />did…”
            Calista began to object.<br />“I’m sorry, mum. All I meant to say is that there is nowhere safe. It’s like
            you always said, ‘nature<br />shows no mercy’”.<br />Tears glistened on Calista’s aging, high cheekbones as
            she turned away wounded, and fearing I may<br />be right. I stared on, out to sea, wishing for all the rum
            and strawberries in the world that I was<br />wrong.<br />The whale song reached a crescendo of desperate
            melancholy, as five tall ebony blades rose slowly<br />out of the water like tombstones. A family of killer
            whales were on the hunt.<br />Far ahead, a line of lights faintly shimmered across the brightening horizon,
            which meant that<br />Tarawa Atoll, at least, had weathered another year of storms.<br />We followed the
            seasweeps in towards one of the decommissioned oil rigs that circled the atoll.<br />Seaweed crops covered
            the supports like the shaggy legs of a gargantuan woolly mammoth, and the<br />rig platforms swarmed with
            figures in overalls processing plastic back into black gold.<br />The island’s mangroves blazed a fierce
            green, ignited by the rising sun. They bathed their buttress<br />roots like a crowd of toddlers in the
            shallow turquoise waters, binding sand to rock, whilst the<br />Mother tree stood proud and tall, guarding
            the fragile earthen heart of the atoll.<br />Making for land, I dropped the black solar sails and folded the
            floats in a vain attempt to sneak past<br />the vine tangled dome of a WW2 gun that took aim at approaching
            ships.<br />Betio harbour was bustling with industry much like any other I’d been to, only in a
            particularly<br />organised manner. Calista checked her blue and white highlighted hair, before hopping
            lightly onto<br />the dock. In a swish of patched, tie-dyed hemp and big sunglasses she was off into the
            throng with<br />her merchandise bag, like a teenager on a field trip.<br />“Cali!” I called after her. “No
            more payment in soft fruits!”.<br /><br />“Ok dear. I’ll be back by 6pm local time. I have a virtual therapy
            session I don’t want to miss”.<br />“Is that you giving the therapy, or receiving?”<br />She winked
            mischievously “I think a bit of both”.<br />My tiredness had reached a level that sleep couldn’t fix, at
            least not until I’d taken a dip to clear my<br />head. I grabbed a swimsuit and ran to catch the beach
            before the flotsam of the cyclone made<br />landfall.<br />Little had changed since I was last in Tarawa,
            save for the trees growing taller, and a few more rigs.<br />But here and there I passed storm scars; a
            swathe of mangrove trees blown down, a houseraft run<br />aground, and everywhere people working hard to
            repair them. It seemed to me like the island’s<br />strength was not in its foundations of shifting sands,
            but in the communities that were holding it<br />together.<br />I stopped at a bathing pool by a honeycomb
            of floating houses, each with a roof garden and a<br />pontoon for tying up canoes.<br />I knew this spot
            well enough to dive in without looking. Pausing a moment to breathe in the<br />memories, I leaped and dived
            down, deep into the water, not caring in that reckless moment how far<br />from safety I may have
            strayed.<br />Suddenly something strong and smooth wrapped around my ankle and pulled me down. Thrashing<br />and
            kicking the thing away, in that blurry blue world I saw the tattooed legs and flippers disappear<br />in a
            burst of bubbles. Reaching the surface I gasped for air and faced my assailant. My fear-driven<br />anger
            melted away to slackjawed surprise.<br />It was Timon.<br />“Crocodile!” he shouted with a smile that
            extended wider than his face.<br />He circled me, his hands tracing the flock of swallows that extended from
            my right elbow to<br />between my shoulder blades. One bird for every 40,000 nautical miles. I was planning
            for them to<br />reach the other elbow, but plans could always be changed.<br />“How are you Gen? I see
            you’ve added a few more birds to the flock. You know swimming here<br />you have to watch out for sea
            kraits. Those snakes have gone crazy since the reef transplant.<br />They’re mainly a problem on land
            though. Don’t worry, I’ll go shake your clothes out for you.”<br />I followed him out of the water. As he
            pulled on a shirt, leaving it open at the front I noticed he’d<br />gained a new tattoo. It sat awkwardly, I
            thought, above the traditionally inked zigzag lines on his<br />torso; a desert island with two palm trees
            in garish bright colours, as if the island were levitating<br />over waves.<br />“I’m ok” I managed to
            reply. “Same old sea, passengers, cargo, Calista… And you? How is life in<br />Kiribati?”<br />“Life here is
            good and even better for seeing you.” He said, shooting me another warming smile.<br />“We’ve had some bad
            storms the last two years and had to dredge and rebuild three islands. One of<br />them was the
            Sponsor’s.”<br />“And they rebuilt his island first, right?”<br />“No, as a matter of fact she insisted we
            work on the other islands first”.<br />“Intriguing” I said. “Perhaps you could tell me about it over a
            drink?”.<br />Walking down the steps into the subterranean shade of the Bunker Bar, my eyes took a while
            to<br />adjust. The air was warm and musty with the scent of sweat and seafood.<br />Timon was talking
            animatedly, plucking ideas out of the air and gripping them between his hands.<br />The seawall project had
            expanded under new funding, he had been elected onto the council, and one<br />day he hoped to run for
            president.<br />We found a seat and ordered.<br />“Enough of politics. Tarawa is self-sufficient, but what
            happens to you at the next food shortage?”.<br />“Oh, we’re ok, what with mum’s microfarm and we’re now
            dabbling in mycology”.<br />“And insects?” he suggested, raising an eyebrow.<br /><br />“Not yet! Though it
            beats me why eating mold is somehow more civilized than bugs. No, honestly,<br />we’re just one duck short
            of self-sufficiency”.<br />“That can be arranged” Timon laughed and slapped my arm. “Now I have a small
            favour to ask. A<br />boat of kids was picked up by a windjammer cruiseship a few weeks ago. Turns out the
            Marshall<br />Islands had a school washed away... I was wondering if you could take them home?”.<br />“Timon,
            I’d love to, but right now I can’t even pay my rent”.<br />“It sounds like you need a Sponsor!” Timon always
            had a solution.<br />“I’m sorry but I can’t take handouts from a Priv”.<br />“Privilege isn’t a bad thing if
            it’s used to do good. I should know, I’m engaged to a ‘Priv’! Honestly,<br />I think you’d like her”.<br />At
            these words I felt my heart burst open and flood upwards, choking in my throat.<br />“Actually I think you
            went freediving with her the last time you were here.” He added.<br />“Hang on... There’s no way Nauri is a
            Priv!”.<br />“Her father died two years ago, and it turns out he was very rich. Anyway, I have to run now. I
            have<br />a Council meeting. No more living on ‘island time’ I’m afraid”.<br />He stood up to leave and
            fixed me with his kind, dark eyes. “Like I said, I know a good Sponsor”.<br />I struggled to speak with so
            much bitterness to swallow.<br />“Well, I bet she doesn’t have an engagement tattoo across the middle of her
            chest.” I blurted out.<br />“No, she doesn’t...” He admitted, his lips curling, suppressing a thought. Then
            he leant in to<br />whisper “hers is somewhere else...”.<br />I watched him skip up the steps where the
            blinding sunlight was streaming in. It illuminated a<br />miniature Milky Way of dust that drifted slowly
            down to impact soundlessly on the sandy floor.<br />Then the young waiter arrived at the table with a plate
            of farmed tiger prawns. My mouth watered,<br />but what I wanted wasn’t on the menu. I sent it to the
            plastic harvester sat nearby, still in her<br />overalls, bags under her eyes as dark as the night she’d
            been working through.<br />“Get her a drink as well” I added as I pressed a bag of coffee beans into his
            hand and two stainless<br />steel teaspoons I’d dived from a wreck. He looked at me confused. “They can be
            melted down” I<br />explained, before heading out into the unforgiving midday sun.<br />The third day dawned
            calm and bright, and fair winds beckoned. Timon and Nauri had been in more<br />meetings but sent their
            regards.<br />“Welcome aboard...” I faltered in front of my blank-faced passengers, wondering if they were
            any<br />good at poker. “Please don’t touch any buttons”.<br />I paused again, trapped in the gaze of a
            dozen pairs of wide eyes, and a malevolent looking duck<br />whom I later named Lorenza.<br />“Oh, and
            especially don’t flush the toilet near land because it converts our waste into sea fertilizer,<br />simulating
            the flocculant of a blue whale.”<br />Eleven confused faces turned towards the tallest boy. “What she means
            is if you press this button<br />the boat will poo like a big fish”.<br />The eruption of laughter startled
            Lorenza, who flapped about and ejected her own fertilizer across<br />the deck, sending the kids hopping and
            shrieking after it.<br />“Calista, no more payments in water fowl”.<br />My mum laughed then too, tears
            glistening on her high cheekbones, and it reminded me that having<br />children aboard really wasn’t safe.
            But then again, nowhere ever was.<br /><br />The small bookshop Taylor owned was closed, its solar lamp
            flicked pointedly off, but after several minutes of persistent knocking there was a loud squawk, and his
            co-owner Sam came to the door with a resigned sigh. “You didn’t have to wake up Darwin,” he muttered
            irritably, brightening a bit when he saw the albatross. Darwin, one of Crate’s few dodos, eyed her
            curiously, his collar jingling as he fluttered onto the coffee table to get a better look at the drone’s
            dissection.<br /><br />#<br /><br />“It’s not a net drone, oddly, though it looks like one,” Sam said at
            last, surveying the scraps. “It’s automata – back before the pureclones, some people tried to bring back
            extinct species through robot facsimiles. The rubberized vaquita were cute – not as realistic as the gen-mod
            versions, of course. But cute.” <br /><br />A jealous beak jostled the table, and Sam reached down to stroke
            Darwin behind his collar. “You’re several strains away from a pureclone, beastie. More pigeon than
            anything,” he muttered, and Darwin puffed his chest feathers with pride before strutting into the kitchen to
            beg another piece of hydroponic seaweed.<br /><br />“If it’s not a net drone, why is it set up like one?”
            Akila asked slowly. <br /><br />Sam’s brow furrowed with a fear she could not place, but he said
            nothing. <br /><br />#<br /><br />Sam suspected that the drone was American in origin, and had veered wildly
            off course after a particularly gnarly hurricane that had flooded much of what remained of Florida. America
            was one of the few countries that still used the old automata builds, he knew from Taylor’s halcyon stories
            of the dog automata of his youth. Taylor always spoke of America fondly. It was as though he remembered only
            the cotton candy of his childhood 4th of July parades, and not the black-clad Vice police, the militarized
            crackdown against “riot boosting.” How each new storm was twisted into the wrath of an angry god, the way
            fear of the rising seas crept up from news chyrons to a choking, ever-present panic. As fires winked red
            eyes across the Western skies, strong men leaders rose like sea walls, promising to protect their flock from
            a new plague. Those who pushed back – who resisted the rush to blame – became blasphemous. <br /><br />The
            economic aftershocks of the collapse of offshore oil – propped up heavily with subsidies – had been the
            first blow. Then, Mexico pulled out of the lucrative trade pacts that had kept drone-retailers headquartered
            in America’s port cities. Much of Silicon Valley, frustrated also by the new taxes on online transactions
            and so-called cultural purity standards for Internet fast lanes, moved offshore, settling into the new stilt
            cities of Southeast Asia and, eventually, floating cities like Crate as sea levels kept rising. <br /><br />Driverless
            transport, once a novelty, had become the backbone of Mexico’s coastal economy, leaving its northern
            neighbor crumbling. And, as the unmanned barges and trucks and trains hummed silently across the globe,
            lonely Crate, once barely a speck of rust in the Indian Ocean, grew into an unlikely metropolis, a jostling
            and jovial mix of devout Sikhs and stateless Deists, Hindu refugees and renegade hipsters. Some, like
            Akila’s parents, were engineers who emigrated to tinker with the drone-barges that stopped by Crate for
            repairs, while others, like Taylor, had escaped the purges of President Cloud, <br /><br />“It was like the
            wild west in the early days,” Taylor said absently. “When I first came, I was writing a story speculating on
            whether Crate would become one of those walled cities, a floating theocracy where nothing ever came in, and
            nothing ever went out. It was a pendulum back then, before Mayor Fawzia, and a slight push in either
            direction –”<br /><br />“Ironically, America went isolationist first.” Sam sank into the couch beside his
            husband, leaning his head onto his shoulder. “Keep Crate weird, wasn’t that our slogan in the early days? It
            seems so long ago…” There was a long silence, broken only by a hydroponic hum, a fluorescent flickering as
            the solar lamps sputtered to life, and the city settled into twilight. <br /><br />Akila had interned for
            Mayor Fawzia one summer, and she remembered the elderly Eritrean woman well, famed as she was for her fiery
            defense of citizenship for the stateless and the Albatross Autonomous Internet, the clamor against
            censorship that had come to define Crate’s destiny. Unlike the walled cities, Crate had turned outwards,
            embracing the castaways who clung to its churning wave energy converters and fashioned its first storm
            barriers out of plastic and broken bottles. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch and other offshore landfills had
            rapidly been subsumed in the desperate days when the floating cities were little more than rafts of tents,
            refugee camps forged by desperation. After decades of tense negotiation, the world’s superpowers at last
            proved unwilling to take in the millions who had relied on bleaching coral archipelagos. Instead, they set
            up the primitive hydrofreight refugee system as a compromise, and sent the starving out to sea with a few
            scattered packets of gen-mod seaweed.<br /><br />Almost at once, tinkerers from around the world had begun
            prodding these curious patches of floating misery. From well-wishers around the world, in packages of every
            shape and size, came solar batteries and hydroponic waste treatment and algae generators and pieces of the
            first-generation storm stabilization systems, the ballasts and spherical barrier walls that had steadied
            Crate through many a tropical typhoon. Most of the heavy lifting was done by the residents themselves -
            refugees who forged a floating city where everyone knew every job and everyone. In the first few
            generations, fixing the barrier shields was done by hand, not by drone, and there was a monument on almost
            every street corner to those who had been lost in the perpetual struggle against the sea. Crate had been
            forced to flounder along on the revenue from seaweed farming for over a decade before finally settling into
            a steady suburban hum, a comfortable carpet of coffee shops and cloning start-ups. These far-flung gen-mod
            firms had later produced pigeon monstrosities like Darwin, who was currently hopping to and fro, sputtering
            indignantly at not being allowed on the couch.<br /><br />Taylor patted him absently, and Darwin cooed,
            momentarily soothed. “At least the pureclones are friendly,” he muttered. “That – that thing on the table is
            not.” Sam shot him a glance.<br /><br />“Should we tell her?”<br /><br />Taylor sighed, settling back to
            stroke Darwin’s feathers. Within a few minutes the dodo was snoring on the rug.<br /><br />“After the Third
            American Exclusion Act, President Cloud started a new crackdown. What you found was a propaganda drone – an
            ancient model, a bit like the net drones social networks used to send out in the old days, before the
            low-orbit satellites made that largely obsolete. Your bird here would have circled the states for thousands
            of miles without stopping, re-routing any signal it came in contact with.”<br /><br />“A very old femtocell
            hack,” Sam said softly. “Not perfect, but fairly unpredictable, and if you get caught with something you
            shouldn’t…” Taylor shuddered. <br /><br />“So it’s the opposite of our albatrosses? Fawzia’s Autonomous
            Internet?” Akila felt a warm sliver of indignation prickle across her chest. <br /><br />Sam chuckled.
            “Technically, I think it’s supposed to be a bald eagle, but the paint wore off. Not much we can do, I’m
            afraid. If we fix the nav system, it might make it home. Otherwise, it’ll just make it to my scrap drawer. I
            might just build a new dodo to replace this one.” He nudged Darwin gently with one foot, and Darwin stirred
            in his sleep and rolled over, scaly feet clasped peacefully across his bulbous belly. <br /><br />Taylor
            chuckled. “Let’s talk about something more pleasant. Tea?”<br /><br /> After a few more pleasantries, Akila
            stumbled out into the twilight, shivering as a fine mist drifted down from the barrier hull far above. A low
            growl echoed through the deserted streets as the barrier hulls tightened, the rings of metal curling like
            petals around the slumbering city after the sun went down. Drifting just east of Madagascar, President Cloud
            and his albatross seemed a world away.<br /><br />#<br /><br />For the next week the albatross circled
            ceaselessly through her thoughts, until at last Akila burst through the shop door, her face flushed,
            startling Sam and frightening Darwin. <br /><br />“The campaign against Pinochet!” she gasped at last.
            Darwin cooed quizzically. “Cloud’s platform is all about fear, right? So you counter it with something
            saccharine, something fluffy and upbeat. Something the censors won’t expect.”<br /><br />“The opposition
            can’t run ads, it isn’t allowed,” Taylor said tersely.<br /><br />Akila sighed, exasperated. “You always say
            politics is a pendulum. So why not try to push it? Why not give the states a real choice for once?”<br /><br />“I
            did try to push it, and it pushed me here,” Taylor snapped. “At least Cloud has one less drone now. What do
            you expect me to do?”<br /><br /> “Why not start with fixing the nav system?”<br /><br />#<br /><br />On the
            eve of the American election, the New Unity Party were facing down the American Lions, President Cloud’s
            party, and, as always, the Green Party, proudly clinging to 5.4% of the electorate. The Lions had long since
            switched to an online voting system, eliminating the former certification process - and a healthy swath of
            voter registrations - to ensure their continued limp to victory.  <br /><br />At 8 p.m. sharp, President
            Cloud’s face flickered across every watch, display, and e-mug in America, promising a golden dawn of
            prosperity. And at 8:04 p.m. an undead albatross plunged into the heart of the Vice Ministry’s media hub, a
            targeted strike on the one zotta-processor through which all communications were routed.<br /><br />The
            video they had chosen was more medley than montage, a slip-shod history that President Cloud denied existed.
            Flappers frolicked on Rockaway Beach before the New Jersey offshore drilling operation collapsed. Ticker
            tape fluttered through Times Square on V-Day, and piles of bananas and papayas glistened in supermarkets
            before the Tropical Fruit Embargo of 2025.  Bayard Rustin mapped out the March on Washington, fading into
            other marches, other speeches, a flipbook of all the pages the Vice Ministry had torn out of textbooks.
            Akila watched with bated breath as the first net drones went up, and Dorothy Vaughn smiled in crisp black
            and white. The U.N. Secretary General announced the creation of the hydrofreights. <br /><br />The video
            sped up, flipping faster and faster from present to past. In the dizzying collage of photos and clippings
            was the full Fibonacci tree of futures, the endless branchings and re-branchings that led, however
            improbably, to President Cloud, to Crate, to a world of walls and albatrosses. She saw the floating cities
            built from scrap, the desperate scrabble for life as superpowers turned inwards. She saw two paths,
            spiraling out from one other, a world spread like a spider web across the sea, a state governed by the
            stateless, and a feudal, frightened world, circling ever inwards. She saw the end of history, and a choice
            in how it would end.<br /><br />The first clusters of no votes appeared, glittering like stars,
            constellations that spun outward from a half dozen cities. The pendulum trembled, then began to tilt. The
            projection shivered, and when the image came back whole swathes of the map gleamed silver. <br /><br />“Even
            if Cloud doesn’t concede they’ll know,” Sam said softly. “They see it now, even if they didn’t before.”<br /><br />Shortly
            before midnight, the New Unity Party began lifting the censorship standards. And, ten thousand miles away,
            Fawzia’s albatrosses flew west on silent silver wings, bringing good luck for a new century.

            Only the cold, untwinkling speck of a space station pierced the darkness between the thinning<br />cumulus
            and the churning ink black sea.<br />The storm sail billowed and creaked, water thundered like rapids
            between the three hulls, and<br />Kraken hydrofoiled a metre clear of the water, slicing through the
            detritus of coconuts and<br />disintegrating plastic that had been whipped into a seething broth by the
            Pacific cyclone wind.<br />My eyes combed the ebony veils for signs of pursuit, but the outcasts’ ramshackle
            vessel couldn’t<br />have made it through. We sailed alone once more.<br />“Argo, thanks for keeping us
            safe”. I finally breathed, with relief.<br />“That is my primary function, and what the storm-runner models
            were designed for, Captain” the<br />ship’s computer replied in calculated soothing tones.<br />“Did you
            notify the GOPs yet?”.<br />“The Global Ocean Protectorate has been informed of the presence of pirates”.<br />“Genius!
            So glad I paid extra for the deluxe system”.<br />“Actually, you just received another message from
            CircularSeas regarding arrears in rental<br />payments. I have reviewed the accounts. May I suggest that you
            cease accepting rum and<br />strawberries as payment?”<br />“Well, you may suggest that. But who would turn
            down a strawberry daiquiri after six months of<br />desalinated water?”<br />“I would” he replied flatly.<br />“Okay.
            But it also doesn’t help that noone ever wants to visit Kiribati. I guess after the nuclear<br />testing it
            just never made it onto the tourist map…” My thoughts drifted into uncertain waters.<br />“Despite my
            superior programming, human behavior remains a mystery to me. Why are we heading<br />for Tarawa Atoll?”.<br />My
            mind whirled, directionless, like a coconut in the cyclone, hoping one day to rest on solid<br />ground.<br />“I
            just wanted to make sure it was still there…”.<br />The hatch snapped open. It was my mother, Calista.<br />I
            always took the nightwatch. It gave me time away from Calista, who had traded in her small blue<br />algae
            business to buy a new pair of ‘dancing knees’ and pay the deposit and first months’ rent on<br />Kraken as
            my Ocean Guardian graduation present. Turned out she couldn’t afford the retirement<br />eco-cruiseship. So
            the day I set sail on my first trade run she showed up at the dock wearing an<br />enormous floppy straw
            hat, carrying four suitcases of mumu dungarees and a micro farming kit,<br />accompanied by Lorenzo, I think
            his name was, waving and shouting “surprise! We’re your first<br />passengers!”. It was a fine day for
            sailing, and the impractical hat barely made it out of Portsmouth<br />harbour. Likewise Lorenzo, who
            disappeared not long after.<br />“Genevieve! Have you seen the bioluminescence? It’s simply divine” cooed
            Calista. “Did you log<br />the sighting yet or shall I?”.<br />“It’s all yours” I replied.<br />Don’t get me
            wrong, I was glad to have my mother aboard. She was an expert at recruiting<br />passengers, and had a
            rather magical way of making Perfect Protein taste like it wasn’t made in a<br />test tube.<br />“I couldn’t
            sleep through that tempest! But thank Gaia, the stars are coming out again now… Did I<br />ever tell you
            that when I was a girl growing up in London I never saw the stars. Even after your grandparents fought to
            get the ecocide laws introduced in the 20s, it took another 10 years or more to clear the smog.”<br />“Yes,
            you did, Cali”. I wasn’t tired of her stories, they gave me perspective.<br />There was a thrumming and
            wailing that sounded like mermaids performing opera inside a tidal<br />power installation. Some 30m off the
            starboard bow the surface of the water was rippling with<br />mechanical strokes, and there following close
            behind, framed in the moonlight, were the finned<br />arches of three whales.<br />“Imagine if it were a
            family of blue whales and a pod of common dolphins” I dreamed aloud.<br />“Well” my mother considered.
            “Maybe one day the rewilding trials will succeed. Whilst there’s<br />frozen genetic material, we have
            hope.” A note of sadness briefly tainted her voice. “I’ll log the<br />sighting. Would you say that was two
            adult humpbacks and a calf following the seasweeps?”.<br />“I think so”. I agreed. “Humpbacks seem to love
            the plankton and clean water the sweeps spit out”.<br />“Do you know a humpback mother whale produces around
            500 litres of milk a day? She’s the super<br />Mama” she mused, wistfully. “I still remember breastfeeding
            you… You used to bite!”<br />“You know I’m 42 years old?!”<br />“Yes. And I will always be your mother, even
            if you refuse to call me Mum since we moved onto<br />this boat.” She hesitated, and then it came spilling
            out. “So… Do you ever think about having<br />children?”<br />“Not anytime soon! Besides, I don’t think it’s
            safe having a baby aboard”. I found myself oddly<br />defensive. She’d never asked me that before.<br />“We
            can make it safe” she reassured. “ And I could do all the baby sitting. It wouldn’t make much<br />difference,
            you never sleep at night anyway”.<br />“Cali, your idea of safe is renting a shoreline house because it’s
            cheap and picturesque and then it’s<br />washed away in the first storm… Your idea of safe is holding a
            cocktail party during a wet bulb<br />event that killed 40,000 people… Your idea of safe is encouraging Dad
            to lead an antinuclear<br />protest at a power plant defended by the Privs’ militia…!”<br />As I spat out
            this last drop of venom I didn’t know I’d been storing, I realised I’d gone too far.<br />“The cocktails
            were medicinal, alcohol free, and we didn’t know the wet bulb was coming. No one<br />did…” Calista began to
            object.<br />“I’m sorry, mum. All I meant to say is that there is nowhere safe. It’s like you always said,
            ‘nature<br />shows no mercy’”.<br />Tears glistened on Calista’s aging, high cheekbones as she turned away
            wounded, and fearing I may<br />be right. I stared on, out to sea, wishing for all the rum and strawberries
            in the world that I was<br />wrong.<br />The whale song reached a crescendo of desperate melancholy, as five
            tall ebony blades rose slowly<br />out of the water like tombstones. A family of killer whales were on the
            hunt.<br />Far ahead, a line of lights faintly shimmered across the brightening horizon, which meant that<br />Tarawa
            Atoll, at least, had weathered another year of storms.<br />We followed the seasweeps in towards one of the
            decommissioned oil rigs that circled the atoll.<br />Seaweed crops covered the supports like the shaggy legs
            of a gargantuan woolly mammoth, and the<br />rig platforms swarmed with figures in overalls processing
            plastic back into black gold.<br />The island’s mangroves blazed a fierce green, ignited by the rising sun.
            They bathed their buttress<br />roots like a crowd of toddlers in the shallow turquoise waters, binding sand
            to rock, whilst the<br />Mother tree stood proud and tall, guarding the fragile earthen heart of the
            atoll.<br />Making for land, I dropped the black solar sails and folded the floats in a vain attempt to
            sneak past<br />the vine tangled dome of a WW2 gun that took aim at approaching ships.<br />Betio harbour
            was bustling with industry much like any other I’d been to, only in a particularly<br />organised manner.
            Calista checked her blue and white highlighted hair, before hopping lightly onto<br />the dock. In a swish
            of patched, tie-dyed hemp and big sunglasses she was off into the throng with<br />her merchandise bag, like
            a teenager on a field trip.<br />“Cali!” I called after her. “No more payment in soft fruits!”.<br /><br />“Ok
            dear. I’ll be back by 6pm local time. I have a virtual therapy session I don’t want to miss”.<br />“Is that
            you giving the therapy, or receiving?”<br />She winked mischievously “I think a bit of both”.<br />My
            tiredness had reached a level that sleep couldn’t fix, at least not until I’d taken a dip to clear my<br />head.
            I grabbed a swimsuit and ran to catch the beach before the flotsam of the cyclone made<br />landfall.<br />Little
            had changed since I was last in Tarawa, save for the trees growing taller, and a few more rigs.<br />But
            here and there I passed storm scars; a swathe of mangrove trees blown down, a houseraft run<br />aground,
            and everywhere people working hard to repair them. It seemed to me like the island’s<br />strength was not
            in its foundations of shifting sands, but in the communities that were holding it<br />together.<br />I
            stopped at a bathing pool by a honeycomb of floating houses, each with a roof garden and a<br />pontoon for
            tying up canoes.<br />I knew this spot well enough to dive in without looking. Pausing a moment to breathe
            in the<br />memories, I leaped and dived down, deep into the water, not caring in that reckless moment how
            far<br />from safety I may have strayed.<br />Suddenly something strong and smooth wrapped around my ankle
            and pulled me down. Thrashing<br />and kicking the thing away, in that blurry blue world I saw the tattooed
            legs and flippers disappear<br />in a burst of bubbles. Reaching the surface I gasped for air and faced my
            assailant. My fear-driven<br />anger melted away to slackjawed surprise.<br />It was Timon.<br />“Crocodile!”
            he shouted with a smile that extended wider than his face.<br />He circled me, his hands tracing the flock
            of swallows that extended from my right elbow to<br />between my shoulder blades. One bird for every 40,000
            nautical miles. I was planning for them to<br />reach the other elbow, but plans could always be changed.<br />“How
            are you Gen? I see you’ve added a few more birds to the flock. You know swimming here<br />you have to watch
            out for sea kraits. Those snakes have gone crazy since the reef transplant.<br />They’re mainly a problem on
            land though. Don’t worry, I’ll go shake your clothes out for you.”<br />I followed him out of the water. As
            he pulled on a shirt, leaving it open at the front I noticed he’d<br />gained a new tattoo. It sat
            awkwardly, I thought, above the traditionally inked zigzag lines on his<br />torso; a desert island with two
            palm trees in garish bright colours, as if the island were levitating<br />over waves.<br />“I’m ok” I
            managed to reply. “Same old sea, passengers, cargo, Calista… And you? How is life in<br />Kiribati?”<br />“Life
            here is good and even better for seeing you.” He said, shooting me another warming smile.<br />“We’ve had
            some bad storms the last two years and had to dredge and rebuild three islands. One of<br />them was the
            Sponsor’s.”<br />“And they rebuilt his island first, right?”<br />“No, as a matter of fact she insisted we
            work on the other islands first”.<br />“Intriguing” I said. “Perhaps you could tell me about it over a
            drink?”.<br />Walking down the steps into the subterranean shade of the Bunker Bar, my eyes took a while
            to<br />adjust. The air was warm and musty with the scent of sweat and seafood.<br />Timon was talking
            animatedly, plucking ideas out of the air and gripping them between his hands.<br />The seawall project had
            expanded under new funding, he had been elected onto the council, and one<br />day he hoped to run for
            president.<br />We found a seat and ordered.<br />“Enough of politics. Tarawa is self-sufficient, but what
            happens to you at the next food shortage?”.<br />“Oh, we’re ok, what with mum’s microfarm and we’re now
            dabbling in mycology”.<br />“And insects?” he suggested, raising an eyebrow.<br /><br />“Not yet! Though it
            beats me why eating mold is somehow more civilized than bugs. No, honestly,<br />we’re just one duck short
            of self-sufficiency”.<br />“That can be arranged” Timon laughed and slapped my arm. “Now I have a small
            favour to ask. A<br />boat of kids was picked up by a windjammer cruiseship a few weeks ago. Turns out the
            Marshall<br />Islands had a school washed away... I was wondering if you could take them home?”.<br />“Timon,
            I’d love to, but right now I can’t even pay my rent”.<br />“It sounds like you need a Sponsor!” Timon always
            had a solution.<br />“I’m sorry but I can’t take handouts from a Priv”.<br />“Privilege isn’t a bad thing if
            it’s used to do good. I should know, I’m engaged to a ‘Priv’! Honestly,<br />I think you’d like her”.<br />At
            these words I felt my heart burst open and flood upwards, choking in my throat.<br />“Actually I think you
            went freediving with her the last time you were here.” He added.<br />“Hang on... There’s no way Nauri is a
            Priv!”.<br />“Her father died two years ago, and it turns out he was very rich. Anyway, I have to run now. I
            have<br />a Council meeting. No more living on ‘island time’ I’m afraid”.<br />He stood up to leave and
            fixed me with his kind, dark eyes. “Like I said, I know a good Sponsor”.<br />I struggled to speak with so
            much bitterness to swallow.<br />“Well, I bet she doesn’t have an engagement tattoo across the middle of her
            chest.” I blurted out.<br />“No, she doesn’t...” He admitted, his lips curling, suppressing a thought. Then
            he leant in to<br />whisper “hers is somewhere else...”.<br />I watched him skip up the steps where the
            blinding sunlight was streaming in. It illuminated a<br />miniature Milky Way of dust that drifted slowly
            down to impact soundlessly on the sandy floor.<br />Then the young waiter arrived at the table with a plate
            of farmed tiger prawns. My mouth watered,<br />but what I wanted wasn’t on the menu. I sent it to the
            plastic harvester sat nearby, still in her<br />overalls, bags under her eyes as dark as the night she’d
            been working through.<br />“Get her a drink as well” I added as I pressed a bag of coffee beans into his
            hand and two stainless<br />steel teaspoons I’d dived from a wreck. He looked at me confused. “They can be
            melted down” I<br />explained, before heading out into the unforgiving midday sun.<br />The third day dawned
            calm and bright, and fair winds beckoned. Timon and Nauri had been in more<br />meetings but sent their
            regards.<br />“Welcome aboard...” I faltered in front of my blank-faced passengers, wondering if they were
            any<br />good at poker. “Please don’t touch any buttons”.<br />I paused again, trapped in the gaze of a
            dozen pairs of wide eyes, and a malevolent looking duck<br />whom I later named Lorenza.<br />“Oh, and
            especially don’t flush the toilet near land because it converts our waste into sea fertilizer,<br />simulating
            the flocculant of a blue whale.”<br />Eleven confused faces turned towards the tallest boy. “What she means
            is if you press this button<br />the boat will poo like a big fish”.<br />The eruption of laughter startled
            Lorenza, who flapped about and ejected her own fertilizer across<br />the deck, sending the kids hopping and
            shrieking after it.<br />“Calista, no more payments in water fowl”.<br />My mum laughed then too, tears
            glistening on her high cheekbones, and it reminded me that having<br />children aboard really wasn’t safe.
            But then again, nowhere ever was.<br /><br />The small bookshop Taylor owned was closed, its solar lamp
            flicked pointedly off, but after several minutes of persistent knocking there was a loud squawk, and his
            co-owner Sam came to the door with a resigned sigh. “You didn’t have to wake up Darwin,” he muttered
            irritably, brightening a bit when he saw the albatross. Darwin, one of Crate’s few dodos, eyed her
            curiously, his collar jingling as he fluttered onto the coffee table to get a better look at the drone’s
            dissection.<br /><br />#<br /><br />“It’s not a net drone, oddly, though it looks like one,” Sam said at
            last, surveying the scraps. “It’s automata – back before the pureclones, some people tried to bring back
            extinct species through robot facsimiles. The rubberized vaquita were cute – not as realistic as the gen-mod
            versions, of course. But cute.” <br /><br />A jealous beak jostled the table, and Sam reached down to stroke
            Darwin behind his collar. “You’re several strains away from a pureclone, beastie. More pigeon than
            anything,” he muttered, and Darwin puffed his chest feathers with pride before strutting into the kitchen to
            beg another piece of hydroponic seaweed.<br /><br />“If it’s not a net drone, why is it set up like one?”
            Akila asked slowly. <br /><br />Sam’s brow furrowed with a fear she could not place, but he said
            nothing. <br /><br />#<br /><br />Sam suspected that the drone was American in origin, and had veered wildly
            off course after a particularly gnarly hurricane that had flooded much of what remained of Florida. America
            was one of the few countries that still used the old automata builds, he knew from Taylor’s halcyon stories
            of the dog automata of his youth. Taylor always spoke of America fondly. It was as though he remembered only
            the cotton candy of his childhood 4th of July parades, and not the black-clad Vice police, the militarized
            crackdown against “riot boosting.” How each new storm was twisted into the wrath of an angry god, the way
            fear of the rising seas crept up from news chyrons to a choking, ever-present panic. As fires winked red
            eyes across the Western skies, strong men leaders rose like sea walls, promising to protect their flock from
            a new plague. Those who pushed back – who resisted the rush to blame – became blasphemous. <br /><br />The
            economic aftershocks of the collapse of offshore oil – propped up heavily with subsidies – had been the
            first blow. Then, Mexico pulled out of the lucrative trade pacts that had kept drone-retailers headquartered
            in America’s port cities. Much of Silicon Valley, frustrated also by the new taxes on online transactions
            and so-called cultural purity standards for Internet fast lanes, moved offshore, settling into the new stilt
            cities of Southeast Asia and, eventually, floating cities like Crate as sea levels kept rising. <br /><br />Driverless
            transport, once a novelty, had become the backbone of Mexico’s coastal economy, leaving its northern
            neighbor crumbling. And, as the unmanned barges and trucks and trains hummed silently across the globe,
            lonely Crate, once barely a speck of rust in the Indian Ocean, grew into an unlikely metropolis, a jostling
            and jovial mix of devout Sikhs and stateless Deists, Hindu refugees and renegade hipsters. Some, like
            Akila’s parents, were engineers who emigrated to tinker with the drone-barges that stopped by Crate for
            repairs, while others, like Taylor, had escaped the purges of President Cloud, <br /><br />“It was like the
            wild west in the early days,” Taylor said absently. “When I first came, I was writing a story speculating on
            whether Crate would become one of those walled cities, a floating theocracy where nothing ever came in, and
            nothing ever went out. It was a pendulum back then, before Mayor Fawzia, and a slight push in either
            direction –”<br /><br />“Ironically, America went isolationist first.” Sam sank into the couch beside his
            husband, leaning his head onto his shoulder. “Keep Crate weird, wasn’t that our slogan in the early days? It
            seems so long ago…” There was a long silence, broken only by a hydroponic hum, a fluorescent flickering as
            the solar lamps sputtered to life, and the city settled into twilight. <br /><br />Akila had interned for
            Mayor Fawzia one summer, and she remembered the elderly Eritrean woman well, famed as she was for her fiery
            defense of citizenship for the stateless and the Albatross Autonomous Internet, the clamor against
            censorship that had come to define Crate’s destiny. Unlike the walled cities, Crate had turned outwards,
            embracing the castaways who clung to its churning wave energy converters and fashioned its first storm
            barriers out of plastic and broken bottles. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch and other offshore landfills had
            rapidly been subsumed in the desperate days when the floating cities were little more than rafts of tents,
            refugee camps forged by desperation. After decades of tense negotiation, the world’s superpowers at last
            proved unwilling to take in the millions who had relied on bleaching coral archipelagos. Instead, they set
            up the primitive hydrofreight refugee system as a compromise, and sent the starving out to sea with a few
            scattered packets of gen-mod seaweed.<br /><br />Almost at once, tinkerers from around the world had begun
            prodding these curious patches of floating misery. From well-wishers around the world, in packages of every
            shape and size, came solar batteries and hydroponic waste treatment and algae generators and pieces of the
            first-generation storm stabilization systems, the ballasts and spherical barrier walls that had steadied
            Crate through many a tropical typhoon. Most of the heavy lifting was done by the residents themselves -
            refugees who forged a floating city where everyone knew every job and everyone. In the first few
            generations, fixing the barrier shields was done by hand, not by drone, and there was a monument on almost
            every street corner to those who had been lost in the perpetual struggle against the sea. Crate had been
            forced to flounder along on the revenue from seaweed farming for over a decade before finally settling into
            a steady suburban hum, a comfortable carpet of coffee shops and cloning start-ups. These far-flung gen-mod
            firms had later produced pigeon monstrosities like Darwin, who was currently hopping to and fro, sputtering
            indignantly at not being allowed on the couch.<br /><br />Taylor patted him absently, and Darwin cooed,
            momentarily soothed. “At least the pureclones are friendly,” he muttered. “That – that thing on the table is
            not.” Sam shot him a glance.<br /><br />“Should we tell her?”<br /><br />Taylor sighed, settling back to
            stroke Darwin’s feathers. Within a few minutes the dodo was snoring on the rug.<br /><br />“After the Third
            American Exclusion Act, President Cloud started a new crackdown. What you found was a propaganda drone – an
            ancient model, a bit like the net drones social networks used to send out in the old days, before the
            low-orbit satellites made that largely obsolete. Your bird here would have circled the states for thousands
            of miles without stopping, re-routing any signal it came in contact with.”<br /><br />“A very old femtocell
            hack,” Sam said softly. “Not perfect, but fairly unpredictable, and if you get caught with something you
            shouldn’t…” Taylor shuddered. <br /><br />“So it’s the opposite of our albatrosses? Fawzia’s Autonomous
            Internet?” Akila felt a warm sliver of indignation prickle across her chest. <br /><br />Sam chuckled.
            “Technically, I think it’s supposed to be a bald eagle, but the paint wore off. Not much we can do, I’m
            afraid. If we fix the nav system, it might make it home. Otherwise, it’ll just make it to my scrap drawer. I
            might just build a new dodo to replace this one.” He nudged Darwin gently with one foot, and Darwin stirred
            in his sleep and rolled over, scaly feet clasped peacefully across his bulbous belly. <br /><br />Taylor
            chuckled. “Let’s talk about something more pleasant. Tea?”<br /><br /> After a few more pleasantries, Akila
            stumbled out into the twilight, shivering as a fine mist drifted down from the barrier hull far above. A low
            growl echoed through the deserted streets as the barrier hulls tightened, the rings of metal curling like
            petals around the slumbering city after the sun went down. Drifting just east of Madagascar, President Cloud
            and his albatross seemed a world away.<br /><br />#<br /><br />For the next week the albatross circled
            ceaselessly through her thoughts, until at last Akila burst through the shop door, her face flushed,
            startling Sam and frightening Darwin. <br /><br />“The campaign against Pinochet!” she gasped at last.
            Darwin cooed quizzically. “Cloud’s platform is all about fear, right? So you counter it with something
            saccharine, something fluffy and upbeat. Something the censors won’t expect.”<br /><br />“The opposition
            can’t run ads, it isn’t allowed,” Taylor said tersely.<br /><br />Akila sighed, exasperated. “You always say
            politics is a pendulum. So why not try to push it? Why not give the states a real choice for once?”<br /><br />“I
            did try to push it, and it pushed me here,” Taylor snapped. “At least Cloud has one less drone now. What do
            you expect me to do?”<br /><br /> “Why not start with fixing the nav system?”<br /><br />#<br /><br />On the
            eve of the American election, the New Unity Party were facing down the American Lions, President Cloud’s
            party, and, as always, the Green Party, proudly clinging to 5.4% of the electorate. The Lions had long since
            switched to an online voting system, eliminating the former certification process - and a healthy swath of
            voter registrations - to ensure their continued limp to victory.  <br /><br />At 8 p.m. sharp, President
            Cloud’s face flickered across every watch, display, and e-mug in America, promising a golden dawn of
            prosperity. And at 8:04 p.m. an undead albatross plunged into the heart of the Vice Ministry’s media hub, a
            targeted strike on the one zotta-processor through which all communications were routed.<br /><br />The
            video they had chosen was more medley than montage, a slip-shod history that President Cloud denied existed.
            Flappers frolicked on Rockaway Beach before the New Jersey offshore drilling operation collapsed. Ticker
            tape fluttered through Times Square on V-Day, and piles of bananas and papayas glistened in supermarkets
            before the Tropical Fruit Embargo of 2025.  Bayard Rustin mapped out the March on Washington, fading into
            other marches, other speeches, a flipbook of all the pages the Vice Ministry had torn out of textbooks.
            Akila watched with bated breath as the first net drones went up, and Dorothy Vaughn smiled in crisp black
            and white. The U.N. Secretary General announced the creation of the hydrofreights. <br /><br />The video
            sped up, flipping faster and faster from present to past. In the dizzying collage of photos and clippings
            was the full Fibonacci tree of futures, the endless branchings and re-branchings that led, however
            improbably, to President Cloud, to Crate, to a world of walls and albatrosses. She saw the floating cities
            built from scrap, the desperate scrabble for life as superpowers turned inwards. She saw two paths,
            spiraling out from one other, a world spread like a spider web across the sea, a state governed by the
            stateless, and a feudal, frightened world, circling ever inwards. She saw the end of history, and a choice
            in how it would end.<br /><br />The first clusters of no votes appeared, glittering like stars,
            constellations that spun outward from a half dozen cities. The pendulum trembled, then began to tilt. The
            projection shivered, and when the image came back whole swathes of the map gleamed silver. <br /><br />“Even
            if Cloud doesn’t concede they’ll know,” Sam said softly. “They see it now, even if they didn’t before.”<br /><br />Shortly
            before midnight, the New Unity Party began lifting the censorship standards. And, ten thousand miles away,
            Fawzia’s albatrosses flew west on silent silver wings, bringing good luck for a new century.
