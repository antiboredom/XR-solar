              >I can feel the anxiety radiating through me as I paddle the kayak with slow, wide motions. What am I
              anxious about, you ask? Nothing in particular. That’s what is so <br />frustrating about it- I feel it all
              the time, even on perfectly nice, ordinary days. I take a <br />deep breath and try to absorb some of the
              tranquility of the environment around me. <br />The sun is almost done rising, the sky a fiery orange,
              with only the barest strokes of <br />indigo around the edges alluding to the fact that it had been dark
              just a few minutes ago. <br />The human world is often relatively quiet at dawn, but here in the marsh
              it’s the loudest <br />time of day. Birds call and swoop down to fish, insects of a thousand types buzz
              with <br />renewed fervor, and frogs make their unmistakable guitar string twangs as my kayak <br />glides
              by almost silently. It’s hard to imagine that only a few decades ago these wetlands <br />didn’t exist in
              the city. <br /><br />I start to feel better as I dock the kayak at the drop spot and climb out into the
              already-<br />busy street. Bikes zoom by in the cycling lane, the trolley trundles past, and there are<br />people
              everywhere, even at this hour of the morning, striding confidently to their <br />destinations. A crowd
              has gathered around some kind of holo-projection, and my <br />curiosity gets the better of me, so I head
              over to check it out. It’s a pop-up presentation <br />on the history of the neighborhood. Unfortunately,
              I only get to watch the first few <br />minutes before I remember that I’m already late to work.
              <br /><br />Max has already opened up shop by the time I arrive. “Joss, late again. What a surprise.”
              <br />He rolls his eyes and makes a gesture of frustration with his laser fabric cutter. “I know,
              <br />I’m really sorry Max. Honest to god I tried. Ijust-” <br /><br />“Oh, spare me the spiel. It’s fine.
              Just to get to work, we have a lot of orders to fill by this <br />evening. Everyone wants an outfit for
              Stellar Night.” <br /><br />I start constructing some blouses according to the patterns projected on the
              screen, and <br />once in a while a customer comes in and I have to show them all the fabric options and
              <br />take their measurements and all that. A few online orders roll in too, nothing too
              <br />complicated. Clothes making is repetitive work, but it’s also creative, and I like doing it.
              <br />It clears my mind, helps me feel focused. <br /><br />When my lunch break finally arrives, however,
              I’m eager to head straight to the used <br />bookstore across the street. Little echoes of my earlier
              anxiety return as I smooth my <br />hair and step back to look at my reflection in the window. I force
              myself to stop stalling- <br />my lunch break is only an hour- and step inside. <br /><br />The jingle of
              tiny bells follows me as I push open the door. My heart swells a little as I <br />look around. Stacks of
              precariously stacked paperbacks, floor to ceiling wooden shelves <br />absolutely crammed, comfy reading
              chairs in the corner. I have so many happy <br />memories here. <br /><br />“Joss! What’s up?” Nora has
              emerged suddenly from behind a bookcase, long dark hair <br />piled on her head and chunky sweater sleeves
              rolled up. “Um, I was just looking for <br />something to read during my lunch break. Do you have anything
              on the history of the <br />neighborhood? This morning there was a pop-up history exhibition that looked
              cool <br />and it reminded me.” <br /><br />“I saw that too!” Nora replies, running her fingers over the
              shelves. “It was fascinating, <br />especially all the stuff about the battles to get cars banned. That
              movement started right <br />around here. I’ve got something perfect. It’s about the change in the urban
              design of the <br />area over time and the accompanying history, causes, effects, anecdotes, all of it.”
              <br />She hands me a short, thick hardcover, clearly at least a few years old. “So, what about
              <br />yesterday’s book? What did you think?” She asks. I am silent for a moment, unable to <br />look away
              from the afternoon sunbeams lighting up her eyes. A fly buzzes nearby, the <br />spell breaks, and I
              regain my powers of speech. “It was epic! A mix of sci-fi, philosophy, <br />mythology,- and the short
              story as a medium served him well..I especially loved the one <br />about AI… what did you think?”<br /><br />“My
              favorite was the one about the killer angels. But I agree with you on all the rest- it <br />was almost
              like poetry, but less tiresome, and more thought provoking. It’s my favorite <br />book of his-”
              <br /><br />“Yes!” I exclaim, “some of his others were a little heavy handed, but this one works very
              <br />well.” <br /><br />We talk on and on, riffing off each other, and by the time I pay for my book and
              leave, <br />my break is almost over. I run back across the street, almost getting hit by a bike, but I
              <br />only have time to inhale a few quick bites of my cheese sandwich before the alarm from <br />the
              sorting room starts blaring. <br /><br />Max is already in the sorting room, fiddling with the machine
              controls. The sorting <br />machine is key, it separates the old clothing into categories, types of
              fabric, quality level, <br />and packs them neatly into bins so we can remake them. But we have a
              particularly <br />cheap, old model from right after people stopped buying new garments, and at least
              <br />once a week it gets horribly stuck on a piece of fabric and grinds to halt. Getting the
              <br />machine unstuck is slow, delicate work, even more so because Max is insistent that we <br />manage
              to recover the offending scrap of velvet or cotton or polyester or whatever it is <br />without tearing
              it. He’s stingy that way. But even such an annoying job can’t wipe the <br />smile off my face today. As I
              work, replay my conversation with Nora over and over <br />again in my head. <br /><br />The rest of the
              afternoon passes by in a rush of deliveries and customers. I close up shop <br />promptly at 5, and wait
              for Max to write me my check. “Enjoy your weekend.” I smile at <br />him as I head out the door. I’m
              tired, and think of sleeping on the trolley, but by the <br />time I get on there’s an air of festivity
              around, and I decide to enjoy the sights of the city <br />instead. Everyone is rushing around like crazy,
              trying to get things done before sunset. <br />Luckily, there’s no line at the bank-cum-post office.
              “Sheila, hi. How are you?” I ask, <br />plunking my check down on the counter between us. She knows the
              drill. “Good, good. <br />We’re having our annual Stellar Night barbecue tonight, Sydney will be there,
              and <br />Maya- a bunch of people. You should come.” <br /><br />“Of course I’ll be there. Thanks for
              inviting me. Last year’s was awesome.” “So, what’s <br />going on with you?” Sheila asks as she scans my
              check and deposits it into my account. <br />“You look over the moon today. Have you finally gotten
              yourself a girlfriend?” <br />“No.” I laugh awkwardly , and suddenly I find myself blurting out everything
              about my <br />conversation with Nora, and how happy it made me. <br /><br />“You know,” she replies, “Sam
              first asked me out on Stellar Night, all those years ago. <br />The first one they ever held. It wasn’t
              even that popular back then, not like it is now. <br />But even so, it was the most romantic thing I’d
              ever seen. It feels like yesterday, and yet <br />here we are, I’m an old hag now, and he’s an old wrinkly
              man!” Sheila laughs, and twirls <br />a strand of silver hair around her finger.<br />“I’ve never heard
              that story before, that is so romantic.” I sigh and lean on the <br />countertop. We both seem to have the
              same thought at the same time, and I blush beet <br />red. “You should try your luck with Nora. Invite her
              to the barbecue! You never know if <br />you don’t ask..” <br /><br />I open my mouth to give my standard
              refusal, but something stops me. I might be going <br />crazy, but maybe it is worth a try. <br />“You
              know what, I think I will. Thank you! I have to get back before the bookstore <br />closes!” I shout on my
              way out the door. What a day this is shaping up to be. Am I really <br />doing this? Now? After so many
              months of not even daring to imagine? I step off the <br />trolley and run right to the bookstore. I know
              that if I allow myself to hesitate even a <br />little, I’ll lose my resolve. <br /><br />“Oh, hi! You’re
              back!” Nora smiles so genuinely that it almost makes me stop in my <br />tracks. My heart is pounding. My
              words tumble out of their own accord, fast and <br />nervous and barely intelligible. “I was wondering, if
              you, um, wanted to go to a Stellar <br />Night Barbecue with me tonight. I think it could be fun, there’ll
              be good food-” <br />“As, like, a date?” She asks, her eyebrows raised. <br /><br />Time slows down. I can
              feel the blood rushing in my head. I have a decision to make. <br />“Yes, as a date.” I say, slowly and
              with conviction. Courage is not the absence of fear, but <br />the fortitude to continue on despite it, I
              remind myself. I can endure this moment of <br />silence. And then she grins, and says “Yes, I would love
              to! It’s my favorite holiday!” I <br />can’t quite believe it, at first. I give her the address, we agree
              on a time to meet, and oh <br />my god this is really happening. <br /><br />I spend hours overthinking my
              outfit, and when the doorbell rings I am unprepared. My <br />housemates tease me viciously as I run to
              answer it, hoping that Nora doesn’t hear them. <br />She looks beautiful, of course. Beautiful isn’t even
              the right word. Radiant. <br /><br />“....Hi.” <br /><br />“Hi.” <br /><br />The long walk up the stairs
              to the roof is a little awkward, mainly because I didn’t have <br />time to clean the house much, but Nora
              doesn’t seem to notice the mess. We’re too busy <br />talking about movies, books, places we’ve been and
              things we want to do. Our voices <br />bounce off the walls of the stairwell, overlap, weave together to
              form a kind of melody. <br />Holding her hand feels like how just-baked cookies smell. If that makes any
              sense. <br /><br />We walk over the bridges between roofs to get to Sheila and Sam’s building. Their roof
              <br />is surrounded by a white iron fence and lots of baby plants waiting to be transplanted to <br />the
              neighborhood garden. The little gate creaks open, and everyone calls out hello. <br />Sydney is grilling
              bean burgers and Sheila is spooning her signature chilli into bowls. <br />Old 2030s pop music is
              blasting, stuff I remember from when I was a kid.<br /><br />“Wanna dance?” Nora asks, taking me by
              surprise. No one else is dancing yet, but we do <br />it anyway. We dance, stupidly, flinging our limbs
              around, having fun. I don’t feel a <br />single drop of fear. A few people cheer, and some join us. Her
              skirt spins, she dips me <br />low and I twirl her around. <br /><br />The colors shift across the expanse
              of sky, blue spreading and deepening. Exhausted, we <br />all sit down to watch the sunset like it’s a
              movie. In that moment, it feels like I’m seeing <br />our city for the first time. The skyscrapers
              glittering, reaching upward, the rows of low <br />buildings lined with trees, the vertical farms in all
              their lush, green glory. Where all this <br />food originated. The massive cargo ships sailing through the
              harbor on the evening <br />wind, their lovely contrast of billowing white sails and flat black solar
              panels. The <br />trolleys dutifully trundling forward over their routes, but mostly empty now. Everyone
              <br />wants to see the spectacle that is about to unfold. <br /><br />A city is such an amazing
              achievement, I marvel. So many different people and systems, <br />all working together in concert, to
              create a city that supports millions of people without <br />harming nature. We’ve been through some
              horribly difficult, unjust times, and so have <br />our parents before that all the generations stretching
              back before them. But look <br />around. We’ve come out the other side. Not only did we survive, we built
              something <br />beautiful. <br /><br />And that’s when it starts. Lights flickering off, all over the
              city. The sky grows darker <br />and darker. The first few stars shine down like beacons. Cheers erupt
              from rooftops all <br />around us, and I yell as loud as I can. When this holiday first started, very few
              buildings <br />actually turned off their lights. People thought that because they were just a little
              light in <br />an ocean of them, it didn’t make a difference either way. But most people know better
              <br />now. Lights go off on every block, in every neighborhood. Each tiny light that <br />disappears
              seems to reveal its parallel in the navy blue sky, sending out its signal from <br />millions of
              lightyears away. By the time the sun is fully gone, the expanse above us is the <br />deepest black,
              painted with hundreds of brilliant constellations. The colors of the milky <br />way become visible, and
              everyone gasps. It’s magical. Like no other beauty on earth. 364 <br />days a year, you can’t see a single
              star in this cram-jammed city. But for one night, we all <br />work together to make this spectacle of
              majesty. <br /><br />Here I am, drunk on love for the universe, surrounded by friends and starlight. I
              decide <br />that this moment will never come again. I lean over and kiss Nora, all the butterflies in
              <br />my stomach taking flight out through my lips. She kisses me back. If all my life so far, all
              <br />my sweat and blood and tears, have been only so that I can achieve this moment in time, <br />it
              would all have been worth it. I break the kiss and lay down flat on the rough concrete, <br />staring up
              at the stars. She leans her head on my shoulder. Humans, I decide, can do <br />anything we set our minds
              to if we work together. If we have solidarity. Even me. <br />Because I am here alive, unafraid, and I
              never thought that would be. We are beautiful <br />together.

              >It’s already pouring by nine am, even though the forecast claimed it wouldn’t start until <br />3. The
              rain plunks onto the leaves above, then streams down in rivulets and drips from <br />the branches, almost
              all of it directly onto Kurt’s head. Or at least that’s how it feels to <br />him. <br /><br />“Goddamn
              weather channel, never right. Bunch of foolhardy schmucks.” Kurt mumbles <br />to himself, with great
              satisfaction. <br /><br />Today is shaping up to be a good day. Not only was the weather report wrong, but
              the <br />torrential rain has mostly deterred visitors, so Kurt has been free to tidy the paths, trim
              <br />branches, and polish the plaques all morning. The more pleasant facet of the job, for <br />him. But
              of course now he’s gone and jinxed it. The bell rings out clearly through the <br />trees. Kurt sighs and
              puts his clipping shears down, shuffling slowly down the path <br />toward the front gate. It takes his
              bad knee some time to kick into gear in the morning, <br />especially when it’s rainy. Management wanted
              to have visitors sign in on a tablet, of all <br />things, which would then send a message to a smart
              watch he would ostensibly be <br />wearing. But Kurt put them off that idea quickly enough. It would have
              ruined <br />everything they were trying to accomplish here! And besides, he thinks proudly, the bell
              <br />is plenty good enough. I can hear it from any part of the forest, even in the rain. <br />The
              unfortunate ringers of the bell stand huddled under the big oak, wielding a colorful <br />assortment of
              umbrellas. Kurt can tell that they have just been squabbling amongst <br />themselves about whether or not
              to leave, but have stopped abruptly now that he is <br />here. An old woman, an exhausted looking middle
              aged couple, and a few teenagers <br />stare at him expectantly. <br /><br />“Hi, I’m Kurt. I’m the
              caretaker here. I can walk you to the tree you’re looking for, unless <br />you already know how to get
              there.” <br /><br />He says this last part rhetorically, because he knows all the regulars, and he’s never
              seen <br />this family before. <br /><br />“Uh, we could use some help.” The middle aged man steps
              forward. “I’m Mark Davis, <br />we’re looking for Richard and Claudia Davis. They’re together, the same
              tree, I think.” <br />Mark says hesitantly. <br /><br />“Alright, let’s get going then.” <br /><br />The
              family takes one last look behind them at the glittering city across the river before <br />following Kurt
              into the dark, dense forest. It provides some shelter from the rain, but he <br />can see them start a
              little at the shadows. There is something about old forests, he thinks <br />as he leads them up the path,
              that will always give people the strange feeling that they <br />are in a fairy tale, no matter how
              advanced science and technology get. The human <br />imagination triumphs. <br /><br />“How long has this
              place been around?” One of the teenagers asks, ducking her head <br />beneath a low branch. “Well, there’s
              three different answers. The forest itself has been <br />around for 400 years, give or take. Although it
              was heavily logged in the intervening <br />years, so very few of the trees themselves are that old. Some
              of the recently planted parts are only a decade or two old. The reserve is 56 years old, but it’s been
              expanded a lot since then. The cemetery is only 19 years old, dates back to the Public Land &amp; Parks
              Act, I’m sure you’ve learned about that in school.” <br /><br />“Wow.” She replies, looking around at the
              forest with new eyes. <br /><br />Now that Kurt is warmed up and in his groove, it’s hard for him to stop
              talking about <br />the place that has been his life’s work. <br /><br />“See those mushrooms over there,
              on that fallen tree? Those are the kind they use to <br />make antidepressants. Scientists used to come
              here to take samples back when they were <br />first testing them.” <br /><br />“That’s so cool!” The
              other teenager, presumably her brother, exclaims. <br />Kurt smiles to himself. He has an encyclopedic
              knowledge of the forest and its history, <br />but generally grieving people don’t want a chatty guide. As
              much as he likes being alone, <br />it’s nice for other people to see, sometimes, why he loves this place
              so much. <br /><br />They arrive at Richard and Claudia Davis’ tree. It’s a young cedar, more than a
              sapling <br />but barley. The soil it stretches its roots into was a parking lot only a few decades ago.
              <br />Mark runs his fingers over the bronze plaques sticking up from the ground and looks as <br />if he
              is about to cry. This is Kurt’s cue to disappear into the forest, leaving them alone <br />with their
              grief. <br /><br />Kurt tries to go back to his work. He really does. He even picks up his clipping
              shears. <br />But his feet move him towards somewhere else, and he knows he can’t fight them,
              <br />stubborn as he is. As he approaches the regal old beech, he tries to pretend he came for <br />some
              other purpose. To neaten up the area. But he can’t. <br /><br />“Hello, Maggie.” He whispers, tracing the
              line where the soft moss gives way to rough <br />bark. “I’m sorry I haven’t come in so long. Sometimes
              it’s just.. Too much. You <br />understand. You always understood me, better than I do myself.” He
              swallows the lump <br />in his throat as he looks down at all the rocks he removed, one by one, when he
              buried <br />her. Still scattered around here, indestructible. <br /><br />“I miss you. That goes without
              saying.You were always wisecracking, my love. Strange <br />as it is to say, I miss being made fun of.
              I’ve taken myself far too seriously since you’ve <br />been … not here.” He takes a deep breath. Wipes the
              mist from his glasses.” <br /><br />“Today I had some visitors that really made me think- wow. Look at the
              magnitude of <br />what we’ve done. Look how we’ve succeeded, despite everything. You and I, we were
              <br />pioneers. I, the quiet one taking care of the trees, you giving them hell in all those city
              <br />council meetings. And now it’s really happened. “We’ve preserved an old-growth forest <br />intact,
              grown it, created a massive carbon sink, protected biodiversity.” He hadn’t talked <br />this way for
              years and years, not since people stopped needing to be convinced.<br /><br />“But you and I both know
              it’s not just that. It’s more than the sum of its parts, more than <br />numbers on a meter. It’s a place
              of comfort, a place where the cycle of life can happen. <br />The trees absorb nutrients, distribute some
              to the younger, weaker ones, talk with each <br />other constantly using tiny electrical impulses
              transmitted by the fungi, which feeds on <br />dead trees. The microorganisms assume a million different
              roles taken on by billions of <br />species, and the insects who sing and light up the night and the birds
              and the deer and <br />the wolves and everything else. We only understand a fraction of it, there is so
              much <br />more that we don’t even know about yet, that we may never know.” <br /><br />His eyes crinkle
              up as he smiles. <br /><br />“Isn’t it amazing that such a system exists? That we helped save it? That
              we’re a part of it <br />all? Isn’t it so heartbreakingly beautiful? Humans have such an obsession with
              straight <br />lines. But nothing is a straight line, that’s missing the point entirely. Everything is a
              <br />circle. Circles within circles within circles, until the end of time….I know you would <br />laugh
              at that long, ponderous speech. But all of it is to say, Maggie my love, don’t worry <br />about me. I’m
              not alone. I’m never alone, here in the imperfect Eden we loved. No one <br />ever is.” <br /><br />With
              that Kurt turns around and starts to walk back to the maple grove, shears in hand. <br />It’s time to stop
              blathering on and go back to doing. He steps forward with confidence, <br />only to trip over a thick,
              twisted beech root, falling to the ground with a muffled thud. <br />“One more prank, eh Maggie?” He asks,
              getting to his feet. <br /><br />And then the sound of an old man laughing fills the air, loud, ugly,
              happy, in a way it <br />hasn’t for a long time. If you listen carefully, you might even hear the trees
              joining in. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you for reading my submissions :)<br /></span

              >I can feel the anxiety radiating through me as I paddle the kayak with slow, wide motions. What am I
              anxious about, you ask? Nothing in particular. That’s what is so <br />frustrating about it- I feel it all
              the time, even on perfectly nice, ordinary days. I take a <br />deep breath and try to absorb some of the
              tranquility of the environment around me. <br />The sun is almost done rising, the sky a fiery orange,
              with only the barest strokes of <br />indigo around the edges alluding to the fact that it had been dark
              just a few minutes ago. <br />The human world is often relatively quiet at dawn, but here in the marsh
              it’s the loudest <br />time of day. Birds call and swoop down to fish, insects of a thousand types buzz
              with <br />renewed fervor, and frogs make their unmistakable guitar string twangs as my kayak <br />glides
              by almost silently. It’s hard to imagine that only a few decades ago these wetlands <br />didn’t exist in
              the city. <br /><br />I start to feel better as I dock the kayak at the drop spot and climb out into the
              already-<br />busy street. Bikes zoom by in the cycling lane, the trolley trundles past, and there are<br />people
              everywhere, even at this hour of the morning, striding confidently to their <br />destinations. A crowd
              has gathered around some kind of holo-projection, and my <br />curiosity gets the better of me, so I head
              over to check it out. It’s a pop-up presentation <br />on the history of the neighborhood. Unfortunately,
              I only get to watch the first few <br />minutes before I remember that I’m already late to work.
              <br /><br />Max has already opened up shop by the time I arrive. “Joss, late again. What a surprise.”
              <br />He rolls his eyes and makes a gesture of frustration with his laser fabric cutter. “I know,
              <br />I’m really sorry Max. Honest to god I tried. Ijust-” <br /><br />“Oh, spare me the spiel. It’s fine.
              Just to get to work, we have a lot of orders to fill by this <br />evening. Everyone wants an outfit for
              Stellar Night.” <br /><br />I start constructing some blouses according to the patterns projected on the
              screen, and <br />once in a while a customer comes in and I have to show them all the fabric options and
              <br />take their measurements and all that. A few online orders roll in too, nothing too
              <br />complicated. Clothes making is repetitive work, but it’s also creative, and I like doing it.
              <br />It clears my mind, helps me feel focused. <br /><br />When my lunch break finally arrives, however,
              I’m eager to head straight to the used <br />bookstore across the street. Little echoes of my earlier
              anxiety return as I smooth my <br />hair and step back to look at my reflection in the window. I force
              myself to stop stalling- <br />my lunch break is only an hour- and step inside. <br /><br />The jingle of
              tiny bells follows me as I push open the door. My heart swells a little as I <br />look around. Stacks of
              precariously stacked paperbacks, floor to ceiling wooden shelves <br />absolutely crammed, comfy reading
              chairs in the corner. I have so many happy <br />memories here. <br /><br />“Joss! What’s up?” Nora has
              emerged suddenly from behind a bookcase, long dark hair <br />piled on her head and chunky sweater sleeves
              rolled up. “Um, I was just looking for <br />something to read during my lunch break. Do you have anything
              on the history of the <br />neighborhood? This morning there was a pop-up history exhibition that looked
              cool <br />and it reminded me.” <br /><br />“I saw that too!” Nora replies, running her fingers over the
              shelves. “It was fascinating, <br />especially all the stuff about the battles to get cars banned. That
              movement started right <br />around here. I’ve got something perfect. It’s about the change in the urban
              design of the <br />area over time and the accompanying history, causes, effects, anecdotes, all of it.”
              <br />She hands me a short, thick hardcover, clearly at least a few years old. “So, what about
              <br />yesterday’s book? What did you think?” She asks. I am silent for a moment, unable to <br />look away
              from the afternoon sunbeams lighting up her eyes. A fly buzzes nearby, the <br />spell breaks, and I
              regain my powers of speech. “It was epic! A mix of sci-fi, philosophy, <br />mythology,- and the short
              story as a medium served him well..I especially loved the one <br />about AI… what did you think?”<br /><br />“My
              favorite was the one about the killer angels. But I agree with you on all the rest- it <br />was almost
              like poetry, but less tiresome, and more thought provoking. It’s my favorite <br />book of his-”
              <br /><br />“Yes!” I exclaim, “some of his others were a little heavy handed, but this one works very
              <br />well.” <br /><br />We talk on and on, riffing off each other, and by the time I pay for my book and
              leave, <br />my break is almost over. I run back across the street, almost getting hit by a bike, but I
              <br />only have time to inhale a few quick bites of my cheese sandwich before the alarm from <br />the
              sorting room starts blaring. <br /><br />Max is already in the sorting room, fiddling with the machine
              controls. The sorting <br />machine is key, it separates the old clothing into categories, types of
              fabric, quality level, <br />and packs them neatly into bins so we can remake them. But we have a
              particularly <br />cheap, old model from right after people stopped buying new garments, and at least
              <br />once a week it gets horribly stuck on a piece of fabric and grinds to halt. Getting the
              <br />machine unstuck is slow, delicate work, even more so because Max is insistent that we <br />manage
              to recover the offending scrap of velvet or cotton or polyester or whatever it is <br />without tearing
              it. He’s stingy that way. But even such an annoying job can’t wipe the <br />smile off my face today. As I
              work, replay my conversation with Nora over and over <br />again in my head. <br /><br />The rest of the
              afternoon passes by in a rush of deliveries and customers. I close up shop <br />promptly at 5, and wait
              for Max to write me my check. “Enjoy your weekend.” I smile at <br />him as I head out the door. I’m
              tired, and think of sleeping on the trolley, but by the <br />time I get on there’s an air of festivity
              around, and I decide to enjoy the sights of the city <br />instead. Everyone is rushing around like crazy,
              trying to get things done before sunset. <br />Luckily, there’s no line at the bank-cum-post office.
              “Sheila, hi. How are you?” I ask, <br />plunking my check down on the counter between us. She knows the
              drill. “Good, good. <br />We’re having our annual Stellar Night barbecue tonight, Sydney will be there,
              and <br />Maya- a bunch of people. You should come.” <br /><br />“Of course I’ll be there. Thanks for
              inviting me. Last year’s was awesome.” “So, what’s <br />going on with you?” Sheila asks as she scans my
              check and deposits it into my account. <br />“You look over the moon today. Have you finally gotten
              yourself a girlfriend?” <br />“No.” I laugh awkwardly , and suddenly I find myself blurting out everything
              about my <br />conversation with Nora, and how happy it made me. <br /><br />“You know,” she replies, “Sam
              first asked me out on Stellar Night, all those years ago. <br />The first one they ever held. It wasn’t
              even that popular back then, not like it is now. <br />But even so, it was the most romantic thing I’d
              ever seen. It feels like yesterday, and yet <br />here we are, I’m an old hag now, and he’s an old wrinkly
              man!” Sheila laughs, and twirls <br />a strand of silver hair around her finger.<br />“I’ve never heard
              that story before, that is so romantic.” I sigh and lean on the <br />countertop. We both seem to have the
              same thought at the same time, and I blush beet <br />red. “You should try your luck with Nora. Invite her
              to the barbecue! You never know if <br />you don’t ask..” <br /><br />I open my mouth to give my standard
              refusal, but something stops me. I might be going <br />crazy, but maybe it is worth a try. <br />“You
              know what, I think I will. Thank you! I have to get back before the bookstore <br />closes!” I shout on my
              way out the door. What a day this is shaping up to be. Am I really <br />doing this? Now? After so many
              months of not even daring to imagine? I step off the <br />trolley and run right to the bookstore. I know
              that if I allow myself to hesitate even a <br />little, I’ll lose my resolve. <br /><br />“Oh, hi! You’re
              back!” Nora smiles so genuinely that it almost makes me stop in my <br />tracks. My heart is pounding. My
              words tumble out of their own accord, fast and <br />nervous and barely intelligible. “I was wondering, if
              you, um, wanted to go to a Stellar <br />Night Barbecue with me tonight. I think it could be fun, there’ll
              be good food-” <br />“As, like, a date?” She asks, her eyebrows raised. <br /><br />Time slows down. I can
              feel the blood rushing in my head. I have a decision to make. <br />“Yes, as a date.” I say, slowly and
              with conviction. Courage is not the absence of fear, but <br />the fortitude to continue on despite it, I
              remind myself. I can endure this moment of <br />silence. And then she grins, and says “Yes, I would love
              to! It’s my favorite holiday!” I <br />can’t quite believe it, at first. I give her the address, we agree
              on a time to meet, and oh <br />my god this is really happening. <br /><br />I spend hours overthinking my
              outfit, and when the doorbell rings I am unprepared. My <br />housemates tease me viciously as I run to
              answer it, hoping that Nora doesn’t hear them. <br />She looks beautiful, of course. Beautiful isn’t even
              the right word. Radiant. <br /><br />“....Hi.” <br /><br />“Hi.” <br /><br />The long walk up the stairs
              to the roof is a little awkward, mainly because I didn’t have <br />time to clean the house much, but Nora
              doesn’t seem to notice the mess. We’re too busy <br />talking about movies, books, places we’ve been and
              things we want to do. Our voices <br />bounce off the walls of the stairwell, overlap, weave together to
              form a kind of melody. <br />Holding her hand feels like how just-baked cookies smell. If that makes any
              sense. <br /><br />We walk over the bridges between roofs to get to Sheila and Sam’s building. Their roof
              <br />is surrounded by a white iron fence and lots of baby plants waiting to be transplanted to <br />the
              neighborhood garden. The little gate creaks open, and everyone calls out hello. <br />Sydney is grilling
              bean burgers and Sheila is spooning her signature chilli into bowls. <br />Old 2030s pop music is
              blasting, stuff I remember from when I was a kid.<br /><br />“Wanna dance?” Nora asks, taking me by
              surprise. No one else is dancing yet, but we do <br />it anyway. We dance, stupidly, flinging our limbs
              around, having fun. I don’t feel a <br />single drop of fear. A few people cheer, and some join us. Her
              skirt spins, she dips me <br />low and I twirl her around. <br /><br />The colors shift across the expanse
              of sky, blue spreading and deepening. Exhausted, we <br />all sit down to watch the sunset like it’s a
              movie. In that moment, it feels like I’m seeing <br />our city for the first time. The skyscrapers
              glittering, reaching upward, the rows of low <br />buildings lined with trees, the vertical farms in all
              their lush, green glory. Where all this <br />food originated. The massive cargo ships sailing through the
              harbor on the evening <br />wind, their lovely contrast of billowing white sails and flat black solar
              panels. The <br />trolleys dutifully trundling forward over their routes, but mostly empty now. Everyone
              <br />wants to see the spectacle that is about to unfold. <br /><br />A city is such an amazing
              achievement, I marvel. So many different people and systems, <br />all working together in concert, to
              create a city that supports millions of people without <br />harming nature. We’ve been through some
              horribly difficult, unjust times, and so have <br />our parents before that all the generations stretching
              back before them. But look <br />around. We’ve come out the other side. Not only did we survive, we built
              something <br />beautiful. <br /><br />And that’s when it starts. Lights flickering off, all over the
              city. The sky grows darker <br />and darker. The first few stars shine down like beacons. Cheers erupt
              from rooftops all <br />around us, and I yell as loud as I can. When this holiday first started, very few
              buildings <br />actually turned off their lights. People thought that because they were just a little
              light in <br />an ocean of them, it didn’t make a difference either way. But most people know better
              <br />now. Lights go off on every block, in every neighborhood. Each tiny light that <br />disappears
              seems to reveal its parallel in the navy blue sky, sending out its signal from <br />millions of
              lightyears away. By the time the sun is fully gone, the expanse above us is the <br />deepest black,
              painted with hundreds of brilliant constellations. The colors of the milky <br />way become visible, and
              everyone gasps. It’s magical. Like no other beauty on earth. 364 <br />days a year, you can’t see a single
              star in this cram-jammed city. But for one night, we all <br />work together to make this spectacle of
              majesty. <br /><br />Here I am, drunk on love for the universe, surrounded by friends and starlight. I
              decide <br />that this moment will never come again. I lean over and kiss Nora, all the butterflies in
              <br />my stomach taking flight out through my lips. She kisses me back. If all my life so far, all
              <br />my sweat and blood and tears, have been only so that I can achieve this moment in time, <br />it
              would all have been worth it. I break the kiss and lay down flat on the rough concrete, <br />staring up
              at the stars. She leans her head on my shoulder. Humans, I decide, can do <br />anything we set our minds
              to if we work together. If we have solidarity. Even me. <br />Because I am here alive, unafraid, and I
              never thought that would be. We are beautiful <br />together.

              >It’s already pouring by nine am, even though the forecast claimed it wouldn’t start until <br />3. The
              rain plunks onto the leaves above, then streams down in rivulets and drips from <br />the branches, almost
              all of it directly onto Kurt’s head. Or at least that’s how it feels to <br />him. <br /><br />“Goddamn
              weather channel, never right. Bunch of foolhardy schmucks.” Kurt mumbles <br />to himself, with great
              satisfaction. <br /><br />Today is shaping up to be a good day. Not only was the weather report wrong, but
              the <br />torrential rain has mostly deterred visitors, so Kurt has been free to tidy the paths, trim
              <br />branches, and polish the plaques all morning. The more pleasant facet of the job, for <br />him. But
              of course now he’s gone and jinxed it. The bell rings out clearly through the <br />trees. Kurt sighs and
              puts his clipping shears down, shuffling slowly down the path <br />toward the front gate. It takes his
              bad knee some time to kick into gear in the morning, <br />especially when it’s rainy. Management wanted
              to have visitors sign in on a tablet, of all <br />things, which would then send a message to a smart
              watch he would ostensibly be <br />wearing. But Kurt put them off that idea quickly enough. It would have
              ruined <br />everything they were trying to accomplish here! And besides, he thinks proudly, the bell
              <br />is plenty good enough. I can hear it from any part of the forest, even in the rain. <br />The
              unfortunate ringers of the bell stand huddled under the big oak, wielding a colorful <br />assortment of
              umbrellas. Kurt can tell that they have just been squabbling amongst <br />themselves about whether or not
              to leave, but have stopped abruptly now that he is <br />here. An old woman, an exhausted looking middle
              aged couple, and a few teenagers <br />stare at him expectantly. <br /><br />“Hi, I’m Kurt. I’m the
              caretaker here. I can walk you to the tree you’re looking for, unless <br />you already know how to get
              there.” <br /><br />He says this last part rhetorically, because he knows all the regulars, and he’s never
              seen <br />this family before. <br /><br />“Uh, we could use some help.” The middle aged man steps
              forward. “I’m Mark Davis, <br />we’re looking for Richard and Claudia Davis. They’re together, the same
              tree, I think.” <br />Mark says hesitantly. <br /><br />“Alright, let’s get going then.” <br /><br />The
              family takes one last look behind them at the glittering city across the river before <br />following Kurt
              into the dark, dense forest. It provides some shelter from the rain, but he <br />can see them start a
              little at the shadows. There is something about old forests, he thinks <br />as he leads them up the path,
              that will always give people the strange feeling that they <br />are in a fairy tale, no matter how
              advanced science and technology get. The human <br />imagination triumphs. <br /><br />“How long has this
              place been around?” One of the teenagers asks, ducking her head <br />beneath a low branch. “Well, there’s
              three different answers. The forest itself has been <br />around for 400 years, give or take. Although it
              was heavily logged in the intervening <br />years, so very few of the trees themselves are that old. Some
              of the recently planted parts are only a decade or two old. The reserve is 56 years old, but it’s been
              expanded a lot since then. The cemetery is only 19 years old, dates back to the Public Land &amp; Parks
              Act, I’m sure you’ve learned about that in school.” <br /><br />“Wow.” She replies, looking around at the
              forest with new eyes. <br /><br />Now that Kurt is warmed up and in his groove, it’s hard for him to stop
              talking about <br />the place that has been his life’s work. <br /><br />“See those mushrooms over there,
              on that fallen tree? Those are the kind they use to <br />make antidepressants. Scientists used to come
              here to take samples back when they were <br />first testing them.” <br /><br />“That’s so cool!” The
              other teenager, presumably her brother, exclaims. <br />Kurt smiles to himself. He has an encyclopedic
              knowledge of the forest and its history, <br />but generally grieving people don’t want a chatty guide. As
              much as he likes being alone, <br />it’s nice for other people to see, sometimes, why he loves this place
              so much. <br /><br />They arrive at Richard and Claudia Davis’ tree. It’s a young cedar, more than a
              sapling <br />but barley. The soil it stretches its roots into was a parking lot only a few decades ago.
              <br />Mark runs his fingers over the bronze plaques sticking up from the ground and looks as <br />if he
              is about to cry. This is Kurt’s cue to disappear into the forest, leaving them alone <br />with their
              grief. <br /><br />Kurt tries to go back to his work. He really does. He even picks up his clipping
              shears. <br />But his feet move him towards somewhere else, and he knows he can’t fight them,
              <br />stubborn as he is. As he approaches the regal old beech, he tries to pretend he came for <br />some
              other purpose. To neaten up the area. But he can’t. <br /><br />“Hello, Maggie.” He whispers, tracing the
              line where the soft moss gives way to rough <br />bark. “I’m sorry I haven’t come in so long. Sometimes
              it’s just.. Too much. You <br />understand. You always understood me, better than I do myself.” He
              swallows the lump <br />in his throat as he looks down at all the rocks he removed, one by one, when he
              buried <br />her. Still scattered around here, indestructible. <br /><br />“I miss you. That goes without
              saying.You were always wisecracking, my love. Strange <br />as it is to say, I miss being made fun of.
              I’ve taken myself far too seriously since you’ve <br />been … not here.” He takes a deep breath. Wipes the
              mist from his glasses.” <br /><br />“Today I had some visitors that really made me think- wow. Look at the
              magnitude of <br />what we’ve done. Look how we’ve succeeded, despite everything. You and I, we were
              <br />pioneers. I, the quiet one taking care of the trees, you giving them hell in all those city
              <br />council meetings. And now it’s really happened. “We’ve preserved an old-growth forest <br />intact,
              grown it, created a massive carbon sink, protected biodiversity.” He hadn’t talked <br />this way for
              years and years, not since people stopped needing to be convinced.<br /><br />“But you and I both know
              it’s not just that. It’s more than the sum of its parts, more than <br />numbers on a meter. It’s a place
              of comfort, a place where the cycle of life can happen. <br />The trees absorb nutrients, distribute some
              to the younger, weaker ones, talk with each <br />other constantly using tiny electrical impulses
              transmitted by the fungi, which feeds on <br />dead trees. The microorganisms assume a million different
              roles taken on by billions of <br />species, and the insects who sing and light up the night and the birds
              and the deer and <br />the wolves and everything else. We only understand a fraction of it, there is so
              much <br />more that we don’t even know about yet, that we may never know.” <br /><br />His eyes crinkle
              up as he smiles. <br /><br />“Isn’t it amazing that such a system exists? That we helped save it? That
              we’re a part of it <br />all? Isn’t it so heartbreakingly beautiful? Humans have such an obsession with
              straight <br />lines. But nothing is a straight line, that’s missing the point entirely. Everything is a
              <br />circle. Circles within circles within circles, until the end of time….I know you would <br />laugh
              at that long, ponderous speech. But all of it is to say, Maggie my love, don’t worry <br />about me. I’m
              not alone. I’m never alone, here in the imperfect Eden we loved. No one <br />ever is.” <br /><br />With
              that Kurt turns around and starts to walk back to the maple grove, shears in hand. <br />It’s time to stop
              blathering on and go back to doing. He steps forward with confidence, <br />only to trip over a thick,
              twisted beech root, falling to the ground with a muffled thud. <br />“One more prank, eh Maggie?” He asks,
              getting to his feet. <br /><br />And then the sound of an old man laughing fills the air, loud, ugly,
              happy, in a way it <br />hasn’t for a long time. If you listen carefully, you might even hear the trees
              joining in. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you for reading my submissions :)<br /></span

              >I can feel the anxiety radiating through me as I paddle the kayak with slow, wide motions. What am I
              anxious about, you ask? Nothing in particular. That’s what is so <br />frustrating about it- I feel it all
              the time, even on perfectly nice, ordinary days. I take a <br />deep breath and try to absorb some of the
              tranquility of the environment around me. <br />The sun is almost done rising, the sky a fiery orange,
              with only the barest strokes of <br />indigo around the edges alluding to the fact that it had been dark
              just a few minutes ago. <br />The human world is often relatively quiet at dawn, but here in the marsh
              it’s the loudest <br />time of day. Birds call and swoop down to fish, insects of a thousand types buzz
              with <br />renewed fervor, and frogs make their unmistakable guitar string twangs as my kayak <br />glides
              by almost silently. It’s hard to imagine that only a few decades ago these wetlands <br />didn’t exist in
              the city. <br /><br />I start to feel better as I dock the kayak at the drop spot and climb out into the
              already-<br />busy street. Bikes zoom by in the cycling lane, the trolley trundles past, and there are<br />people
              everywhere, even at this hour of the morning, striding confidently to their <br />destinations. A crowd
              has gathered around some kind of holo-projection, and my <br />curiosity gets the better of me, so I head
              over to check it out. It’s a pop-up presentation <br />on the history of the neighborhood. Unfortunately,
              I only get to watch the first few <br />minutes before I remember that I’m already late to work.
              <br /><br />Max has already opened up shop by the time I arrive. “Joss, late again. What a surprise.”
              <br />He rolls his eyes and makes a gesture of frustration with his laser fabric cutter. “I know,
              <br />I’m really sorry Max. Honest to god I tried. Ijust-” <br /><br />“Oh, spare me the spiel. It’s fine.
              Just to get to work, we have a lot of orders to fill by this <br />evening. Everyone wants an outfit for
              Stellar Night.” <br /><br />I start constructing some blouses according to the patterns projected on the
              screen, and <br />once in a while a customer comes in and I have to show them all the fabric options and
              <br />take their measurements and all that. A few online orders roll in too, nothing too
              <br />complicated. Clothes making is repetitive work, but it’s also creative, and I like doing it.
              <br />It clears my mind, helps me feel focused. <br /><br />When my lunch break finally arrives, however,
              I’m eager to head straight to the used <br />bookstore across the street. Little echoes of my earlier
              anxiety return as I smooth my <br />hair and step back to look at my reflection in the window. I force
              myself to stop stalling- <br />my lunch break is only an hour- and step inside. <br /><br />The jingle of
              tiny bells follows me as I push open the door. My heart swells a little as I <br />look around. Stacks of
              precariously stacked paperbacks, floor to ceiling wooden shelves <br />absolutely crammed, comfy reading
              chairs in the corner. I have so many happy <br />memories here. <br /><br />“Joss! What’s up?” Nora has
              emerged suddenly from behind a bookcase, long dark hair <br />piled on her head and chunky sweater sleeves
              rolled up. “Um, I was just looking for <br />something to read during my lunch break. Do you have anything
              on the history of the <br />neighborhood? This morning there was a pop-up history exhibition that looked
              cool <br />and it reminded me.” <br /><br />“I saw that too!” Nora replies, running her fingers over the
              shelves. “It was fascinating, <br />especially all the stuff about the battles to get cars banned. That
              movement started right <br />around here. I’ve got something perfect. It’s about the change in the urban
              design of the <br />area over time and the accompanying history, causes, effects, anecdotes, all of it.”
              <br />She hands me a short, thick hardcover, clearly at least a few years old. “So, what about
              <br />yesterday’s book? What did you think?” She asks. I am silent for a moment, unable to <br />look away
              from the afternoon sunbeams lighting up her eyes. A fly buzzes nearby, the <br />spell breaks, and I
              regain my powers of speech. “It was epic! A mix of sci-fi, philosophy, <br />mythology,- and the short
              story as a medium served him well..I especially loved the one <br />about AI… what did you think?”<br /><br />“My
              favorite was the one about the killer angels. But I agree with you on all the rest- it <br />was almost
              like poetry, but less tiresome, and more thought provoking. It’s my favorite <br />book of his-”
              <br /><br />“Yes!” I exclaim, “some of his others were a little heavy handed, but this one works very
              <br />well.” <br /><br />We talk on and on, riffing off each other, and by the time I pay for my book and
              leave, <br />my break is almost over. I run back across the street, almost getting hit by a bike, but I
              <br />only have time to inhale a few quick bites of my cheese sandwich before the alarm from <br />the
              sorting room starts blaring. <br /><br />Max is already in the sorting room, fiddling with the machine
              controls. The sorting <br />machine is key, it separates the old clothing into categories, types of
              fabric, quality level, <br />and packs them neatly into bins so we can remake them. But we have a
              particularly <br />cheap, old model from right after people stopped buying new garments, and at least
              <br />once a week it gets horribly stuck on a piece of fabric and grinds to halt. Getting the
              <br />machine unstuck is slow, delicate work, even more so because Max is insistent that we <br />manage
              to recover the offending scrap of velvet or cotton or polyester or whatever it is <br />without tearing
              it. He’s stingy that way. But even such an annoying job can’t wipe the <br />smile off my face today. As I
              work, replay my conversation with Nora over and over <br />again in my head. <br /><br />The rest of the
              afternoon passes by in a rush of deliveries and customers. I close up shop <br />promptly at 5, and wait
              for Max to write me my check. “Enjoy your weekend.” I smile at <br />him as I head out the door. I’m
              tired, and think of sleeping on the trolley, but by the <br />time I get on there’s an air of festivity
              around, and I decide to enjoy the sights of the city <br />instead. Everyone is rushing around like crazy,
              trying to get things done before sunset. <br />Luckily, there’s no line at the bank-cum-post office.
              “Sheila, hi. How are you?” I ask, <br />plunking my check down on the counter between us. She knows the
              drill. “Good, good. <br />We’re having our annual Stellar Night barbecue tonight, Sydney will be there,
              and <br />Maya- a bunch of people. You should come.” <br /><br />“Of course I’ll be there. Thanks for
              inviting me. Last year’s was awesome.” “So, what’s <br />going on with you?” Sheila asks as she scans my
              check and deposits it into my account. <br />“You look over the moon today. Have you finally gotten
              yourself a girlfriend?” <br />“No.” I laugh awkwardly , and suddenly I find myself blurting out everything
              about my <br />conversation with Nora, and how happy it made me. <br /><br />“You know,” she replies, “Sam
              first asked me out on Stellar Night, all those years ago. <br />The first one they ever held. It wasn’t
              even that popular back then, not like it is now. <br />But even so, it was the most romantic thing I’d
              ever seen. It feels like yesterday, and yet <br />here we are, I’m an old hag now, and he’s an old wrinkly
              man!” Sheila laughs, and twirls <br />a strand of silver hair around her finger.<br />“I’ve never heard
              that story before, that is so romantic.” I sigh and lean on the <br />countertop. We both seem to have the
              same thought at the same time, and I blush beet <br />red. “You should try your luck with Nora. Invite her
              to the barbecue! You never know if <br />you don’t ask..” <br /><br />I open my mouth to give my standard
              refusal, but something stops me. I might be going <br />crazy, but maybe it is worth a try. <br />“You
              know what, I think I will. Thank you! I have to get back before the bookstore <br />closes!” I shout on my
              way out the door. What a day this is shaping up to be. Am I really <br />doing this? Now? After so many
              months of not even daring to imagine? I step off the <br />trolley and run right to the bookstore. I know
              that if I allow myself to hesitate even a <br />little, I’ll lose my resolve. <br /><br />“Oh, hi! You’re
              back!” Nora smiles so genuinely that it almost makes me stop in my <br />tracks. My heart is pounding. My
              words tumble out of their own accord, fast and <br />nervous and barely intelligible. “I was wondering, if
              you, um, wanted to go to a Stellar <br />Night Barbecue with me tonight. I think it could be fun, there’ll
              be good food-” <br />“As, like, a date?” She asks, her eyebrows raised. <br /><br />Time slows down. I can
              feel the blood rushing in my head. I have a decision to make. <br />“Yes, as a date.” I say, slowly and
              with conviction. Courage is not the absence of fear, but <br />the fortitude to continue on despite it, I
              remind myself. I can endure this moment of <br />silence. And then she grins, and says “Yes, I would love
              to! It’s my favorite holiday!” I <br />can’t quite believe it, at first. I give her the address, we agree
              on a time to meet, and oh <br />my god this is really happening. <br /><br />I spend hours overthinking my
              outfit, and when the doorbell rings I am unprepared. My <br />housemates tease me viciously as I run to
              answer it, hoping that Nora doesn’t hear them. <br />She looks beautiful, of course. Beautiful isn’t even
              the right word. Radiant. <br /><br />“....Hi.” <br /><br />“Hi.” <br /><br />The long walk up the stairs
              to the roof is a little awkward, mainly because I didn’t have <br />time to clean the house much, but Nora
              doesn’t seem to notice the mess. We’re too busy <br />talking about movies, books, places we’ve been and
              things we want to do. Our voices <br />bounce off the walls of the stairwell, overlap, weave together to
              form a kind of melody. <br />Holding her hand feels like how just-baked cookies smell. If that makes any
              sense. <br /><br />We walk over the bridges between roofs to get to Sheila and Sam’s building. Their roof
              <br />is surrounded by a white iron fence and lots of baby plants waiting to be transplanted to <br />the
              neighborhood garden. The little gate creaks open, and everyone calls out hello. <br />Sydney is grilling
              bean burgers and Sheila is spooning her signature chilli into bowls. <br />Old 2030s pop music is
              blasting, stuff I remember from when I was a kid.<br /><br />“Wanna dance?” Nora asks, taking me by
              surprise. No one else is dancing yet, but we do <br />it anyway. We dance, stupidly, flinging our limbs
              around, having fun. I don’t feel a <br />single drop of fear. A few people cheer, and some join us. Her
              skirt spins, she dips me <br />low and I twirl her around. <br /><br />The colors shift across the expanse
              of sky, blue spreading and deepening. Exhausted, we <br />all sit down to watch the sunset like it’s a
              movie. In that moment, it feels like I’m seeing <br />our city for the first time. The skyscrapers
              glittering, reaching upward, the rows of low <br />buildings lined with trees, the vertical farms in all
              their lush, green glory. Where all this <br />food originated. The massive cargo ships sailing through the
              harbor on the evening <br />wind, their lovely contrast of billowing white sails and flat black solar
              panels. The <br />trolleys dutifully trundling forward over their routes, but mostly empty now. Everyone
              <br />wants to see the spectacle that is about to unfold. <br /><br />A city is such an amazing
              achievement, I marvel. So many different people and systems, <br />all working together in concert, to
              create a city that supports millions of people without <br />harming nature. We’ve been through some
              horribly difficult, unjust times, and so have <br />our parents before that all the generations stretching
              back before them. But look <br />around. We’ve come out the other side. Not only did we survive, we built
              something <br />beautiful. <br /><br />And that’s when it starts. Lights flickering off, all over the
              city. The sky grows darker <br />and darker. The first few stars shine down like beacons. Cheers erupt
              from rooftops all <br />around us, and I yell as loud as I can. When this holiday first started, very few
              buildings <br />actually turned off their lights. People thought that because they were just a little
              light in <br />an ocean of them, it didn’t make a difference either way. But most people know better
              <br />now. Lights go off on every block, in every neighborhood. Each tiny light that <br />disappears
              seems to reveal its parallel in the navy blue sky, sending out its signal from <br />millions of
              lightyears away. By the time the sun is fully gone, the expanse above us is the <br />deepest black,
              painted with hundreds of brilliant constellations. The colors of the milky <br />way become visible, and
              everyone gasps. It’s magical. Like no other beauty on earth. 364 <br />days a year, you can’t see a single
              star in this cram-jammed city. But for one night, we all <br />work together to make this spectacle of
              majesty. <br /><br />Here I am, drunk on love for the universe, surrounded by friends and starlight. I
              decide <br />that this moment will never come again. I lean over and kiss Nora, all the butterflies in
              <br />my stomach taking flight out through my lips. She kisses me back. If all my life so far, all
              <br />my sweat and blood and tears, have been only so that I can achieve this moment in time, <br />it
              would all have been worth it. I break the kiss and lay down flat on the rough concrete, <br />staring up
              at the stars. She leans her head on my shoulder. Humans, I decide, can do <br />anything we set our minds
              to if we work together. If we have solidarity. Even me. <br />Because I am here alive, unafraid, and I
              never thought that would be. We are beautiful <br />together.

            ><span class="span-3"
              >It’s already pouring by nine am, even though the forecast claimed it wouldn’t start until <br />3. The
              rain plunks onto the leaves above, then streams down in rivulets and drips from <br />the branches, almost
              all of it directly onto Kurt’s head. Or at least that’s how it feels to <br />him. <br /><br />“Goddamn
              weather channel, never right. Bunch of foolhardy schmucks.” Kurt mumbles <br />to himself, with great
              satisfaction. <br /><br />Today is shaping up to be a good day. Not only was the weather report wrong, but
              the <br />torrential rain has mostly deterred visitors, so Kurt has been free to tidy the paths, trim
              <br />branches, and polish the plaques all morning. The more pleasant facet of the job, for <br />him. But
              of course now he’s gone and jinxed it. The bell rings out clearly through the <br />trees. Kurt sighs and
              puts his clipping shears down, shuffling slowly down the path <br />toward the front gate. It takes his
              bad knee some time to kick into gear in the morning, <br />especially when it’s rainy. Management wanted
              to have visitors sign in on a tablet, of all <br />things, which would then send a message to a smart
              watch he would ostensibly be <br />wearing. But Kurt put them off that idea quickly enough. It would have
              ruined <br />everything they were trying to accomplish here! And besides, he thinks proudly, the bell
              <br />is plenty good enough. I can hear it from any part of the forest, even in the rain. <br />The
              unfortunate ringers of the bell stand huddled under the big oak, wielding a colorful <br />assortment of
              umbrellas. Kurt can tell that they have just been squabbling amongst <br />themselves about whether or not
              to leave, but have stopped abruptly now that he is <br />here. An old woman, an exhausted looking middle
              aged couple, and a few teenagers <br />stare at him expectantly. <br /><br />“Hi, I’m Kurt. I’m the
              caretaker here. I can walk you to the tree you’re looking for, unless <br />you already know how to get
              there.” <br /><br />He says this last part rhetorically, because he knows all the regulars, and he’s never
              seen <br />this family before. <br /><br />“Uh, we could use some help.” The middle aged man steps
              forward. “I’m Mark Davis, <br />we’re looking for Richard and Claudia Davis. They’re together, the same
              tree, I think.” <br />Mark says hesitantly. <br /><br />“Alright, let’s get going then.” <br /><br />The
              family takes one last look behind them at the glittering city across the river before <br />following Kurt
              into the dark, dense forest. It provides some shelter from the rain, but he <br />can see them start a
              little at the shadows. There is something about old forests, he thinks <br />as he leads them up the path,
              that will always give people the strange feeling that they <br />are in a fairy tale, no matter how
              advanced science and technology get. The human <br />imagination triumphs. <br /><br />“How long has this
              place been around?” One of the teenagers asks, ducking her head <br />beneath a low branch. “Well, there’s
              three different answers. The forest itself has been <br />around for 400 years, give or take. Although it
              was heavily logged in the intervening <br />years, so very few of the trees themselves are that old. Some
              of the recently planted parts are only a decade or two old. The reserve is 56 years old, but it’s been
              expanded a lot since then. The cemetery is only 19 years old, dates back to the Public Land &amp; Parks
              Act, I’m sure you’ve learned about that in school.” <br /><br />“Wow.” She replies, looking around at the
              forest with new eyes. <br /><br />Now that Kurt is warmed up and in his groove, it’s hard for him to stop
              talking about <br />the place that has been his life’s work. <br /><br />“See those mushrooms over there,
              on that fallen tree? Those are the kind they use to <br />make antidepressants. Scientists used to come
              here to take samples back when they were <br />first testing them.” <br /><br />“That’s so cool!” The
              other teenager, presumably her brother, exclaims. <br />Kurt smiles to himself. He has an encyclopedic
              knowledge of the forest and its history, <br />but generally grieving people don’t want a chatty guide. As
              much as he likes being alone, <br />it’s nice for other people to see, sometimes, why he loves this place
              so much. <br /><br />They arrive at Richard and Claudia Davis’ tree. It’s a young cedar, more than a
              sapling <br />but barley. The soil it stretches its roots into was a parking lot only a few decades ago.
              <br />Mark runs his fingers over the bronze plaques sticking up from the ground and looks as <br />if he
              is about to cry. This is Kurt’s cue to disappear into the forest, leaving them alone <br />with their
              grief. <br /><br />Kurt tries to go back to his work. He really does. He even picks up his clipping
              shears. <br />But his feet move him towards somewhere else, and he knows he can’t fight them,
              <br />stubborn as he is. As he approaches the regal old beech, he tries to pretend he came for <br />some
              other purpose. To neaten up the area. But he can’t. <br /><br />“Hello, Maggie.” He whispers, tracing the
              line where the soft moss gives way to rough <br />bark. “I’m sorry I haven’t come in so long. Sometimes
              it’s just.. Too much. You <br />understand. You always understood me, better than I do myself.” He
              swallows the lump <br />in his throat as he looks down at all the rocks he removed, one by one, when he
              buried <br />her. Still scattered around here, indestructible. <br /><br />“I miss you. That goes without
              saying.You were always wisecracking, my love. Strange <br />as it is to say, I miss being made fun of.
              I’ve taken myself far too seriously since you’ve <br />been … not here.” He takes a deep breath. Wipes the
              mist from his glasses.” <br /><br />“Today I had some visitors that really made me think- wow. Look at the
              magnitude of <br />what we’ve done. Look how we’ve succeeded, despite everything. You and I, we were
              <br />pioneers. I, the quiet one taking care of the trees, you giving them hell in all those city
              <br />council meetings. And now it’s really happened. “We’ve preserved an old-growth forest <br />intact,
              grown it, created a massive carbon sink, protected biodiversity.” He hadn’t talked <br />this way for
              years and years, not since people stopped needing to be convinced.<br /><br />“But you and I both know
              it’s not just that. It’s more than the sum of its parts, more than <br />numbers on a meter. It’s a place
              of comfort, a place where the cycle of life can happen. <br />The trees absorb nutrients, distribute some
              to the younger, weaker ones, talk with each <br />other constantly using tiny electrical impulses
              transmitted by the fungi, which feeds on <br />dead trees. The microorganisms assume a million different
              roles taken on by billions of <br />species, and the insects who sing and light up the night and the birds
              and the deer and <br />the wolves and everything else. We only understand a fraction of it, there is so
              much <br />more that we don’t even know about yet, that we may never know.” <br /><br />His eyes crinkle
              up as he smiles. <br /><br />“Isn’t it amazing that such a system exists? That we helped save it? That
              we’re a part of it <br />all? Isn’t it so heartbreakingly beautiful? Humans have such an obsession with
              straight <br />lines. But nothing is a straight line, that’s missing the point entirely. Everything is a
              <br />circle. Circles within circles within circles, until the end of time….I know you would <br />laugh
              at that long, ponderous speech. But all of it is to say, Maggie my love, don’t worry <br />about me. I’m
              not alone. I’m never alone, here in the imperfect Eden we loved. No one <br />ever is.” <br /><br />With
              that Kurt turns around and starts to walk back to the maple grove, shears in hand. <br />It’s time to stop
              blathering on and go back to doing. He steps forward with confidence, <br />only to trip over a thick,
              twisted beech root, falling to the ground with a muffled thud. <br />“One more prank, eh Maggie?” He asks,
              getting to his feet. <br /><br />And then the sound of an old man laughing fills the air, loud, ugly,
              happy, in a way it <br />hasn’t for a long time. If you listen carefully, you might even hear the trees
              joining in. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you for reading my submissions :)<br /></span
