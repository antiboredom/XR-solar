			<h1>Return to Kiribati</h1>
			<h2>by Alexandra Porter</h2>
			<img src=/images/rectangle-43-19@1x.png class=pencil>

			<div class="story-text">
				<p>Only the cold, untwinkling speck of a space station pierced the darkness between the thinning
cumulus and the churning ink black sea.
The storm sail billowed and creaked, water thundered like rapids between the three hulls, and
Kraken hydrofoiled a metre clear of the water, slicing through the detritus of coconuts and
disintegrating plastic that had been whipped into a seething broth by the Pacific cyclone wind.
My eyes combed the ebony veils for signs of pursuit, but the outcasts’ ramshackle vessel couldn’t
have made it through. We sailed alone once more.
“Argo, thanks for keeping us safe”. I finally breathed, with relief.
“That is my primary function, and what the storm-runner models were designed for, Captain” the
ship’s computer replied in calculated soothing tones.
“Did you notify the GOPs yet?”.
“The Global Ocean Protectorate has been informed of the presence of pirates”.
“Genius! So glad I paid extra for the deluxe system”.
“Actually, you just received another message from CircularSeas regarding arrears in rental
payments. I have reviewed the accounts. May I suggest that you cease accepting rum and
strawberries as payment?”
“Well, you may suggest that. But who would turn down a strawberry daiquiri after six months of
desalinated water?”
“I would” he replied flatly.
“Okay. But it also doesn’t help that noone ever wants to visit Kiribati. I guess after the nuclear
testing it just never made it onto the tourist map…” My thoughts drifted into uncertain waters.
“Despite my superior programming, human behavior remains a mystery to me. Why are we heading
for Tarawa Atoll?”.
My mind whirled, directionless, like a coconut in the cyclone, hoping one day to rest on solid
ground.
“I just wanted to make sure it was still there…”.
The hatch snapped open. It was my mother, Calista.
I always took the nightwatch. It gave me time away from Calista, who had traded in her small blue
algae business to buy a new pair of ‘dancing knees’ and pay the deposit and first months’ rent on
Kraken as my Ocean Guardian graduation present. Turned out she couldn’t afford the retirement
eco-cruiseship. So the day I set sail on my first trade run she showed up at the dock wearing an
enormous floppy straw hat, carrying four suitcases of mumu dungarees and a micro farming kit,
accompanied by Lorenzo, I think his name was, waving and shouting “surprise! We’re your first
passengers!”. It was a fine day for sailing, and the impractical hat barely made it out of Portsmouth
harbour. Likewise Lorenzo, who disappeared not long after.
“Genevieve! Have you seen the bioluminescence? It’s simply divine” cooed Calista. “Did you log
the sighting yet or shall I?”.
“It’s all yours” I replied.
Don’t get me wrong, I was glad to have my mother aboard. She was an expert at recruiting
passengers, and had a rather magical way of making Perfect Protein taste like it wasn’t made in a
test tube.
“I couldn’t sleep through that tempest! But thank Gaia, the stars are coming out again now… Did I
ever tell you that when I was a girl growing up in London I never saw the stars. Even after your</p>
<p>grandparents fought to get the ecocide laws introduced in the 20s, it took another 10 years or more
to clear the smog.”
“Yes, you did, Cali”. I wasn’t tired of her stories, they gave me perspective.
There was a thrumming and wailing that sounded like mermaids performing opera inside a tidal
power installation. Some 30m off the starboard bow the surface of the water was rippling with
mechanical strokes, and there following close behind, framed in the moonlight, were the finned
arches of three whales.
“Imagine if it were a family of blue whales and a pod of common dolphins” I dreamed aloud.
“Well” my mother considered. “Maybe one day the rewilding trials will succeed. Whilst there’s
frozen genetic material, we have hope.” A note of sadness briefly tainted her voice. “I’ll log the
sighting. Would you say that was two adult humpbacks and a calf following the seasweeps?”.
“I think so”. I agreed. “Humpbacks seem to love the plankton and clean water the sweeps spit out”.
“Do you know a humpback mother whale produces around 500 litres of milk a day? She’s the super
Mama” she mused, wistfully. “I still remember breastfeeding you… You used to bite!”
“You know I’m 42 years old?!”
“Yes. And I will always be your mother, even if you refuse to call me Mum since we moved onto
this boat.” She hesitated, and then it came spilling out. “So… Do you ever think about having
children?”
“Not anytime soon! Besides, I don’t think it’s safe having a baby aboard”. I found myself oddly
defensive. She’d never asked me that before.
“We can make it safe” she reassured. “ And I could do all the baby sitting. It wouldn’t make much
difference, you never sleep at night anyway”.
“Cali, your idea of safe is renting a shoreline house because it’s cheap and picturesque and then it’s
washed away in the first storm… Your idea of safe is holding a cocktail party during a wet bulb
event that killed 40,000 people… Your idea of safe is encouraging Dad to lead an antinuclear
protest at a power plant defended by the Privs’ militia…!”
As I spat out this last drop of venom I didn’t know I’d been storing, I realised I’d gone too far.
“The cocktails were medicinal, alcohol free, and we didn’t know the wet bulb was coming. No one
did…” Calista began to object.
“I’m sorry, mum. All I meant to say is that there is nowhere safe. It’s like you always said, ‘nature
shows no mercy’”.
Tears glistened on Calista’s aging, high cheekbones as she turned away wounded, and fearing I may
be right. I stared on, out to sea, wishing for all the rum and strawberries in the world that I was
wrong.
The whale song reached a crescendo of desperate melancholy, as five tall ebony blades rose slowly
out of the water like tombstones. A family of killer whales were on the hunt.
Far ahead, a line of lights faintly shimmered across the brightening horizon, which meant that
Tarawa Atoll, at least, had weathered another year of storms.
We followed the seasweeps in towards one of the decommissioned oil rigs that circled the atoll.
Seaweed crops covered the supports like the shaggy legs of a gargantuan woolly mammoth, and the
rig platforms swarmed with figures in overalls processing plastic back into black gold.
The island’s mangroves blazed a fierce green, ignited by the rising sun. They bathed their buttress
roots like a crowd of toddlers in the shallow turquoise waters, binding sand to rock, whilst the
Mother tree stood proud and tall, guarding the fragile earthen heart of the atoll.
Making for land, I dropped the black solar sails and folded the floats in a vain attempt to sneak past
the vine tangled dome of a WW2 gun that took aim at approaching ships.
Betio harbour was bustling with industry much like any other I’d been to, only in a particularly
organised manner. Calista checked her blue and white highlighted hair, before hopping lightly onto
the dock. In a swish of patched, tie-dyed hemp and big sunglasses she was off into the throng with
her merchandise bag, like a teenager on a field trip.
“Cali!” I called after her. “No more payment in soft fruits!”.</p>
<p>“Ok dear. I’ll be back by 6pm local time. I have a virtual therapy session I don’t want to miss”.
“Is that you giving the therapy, or receiving?”
She winked mischievously “I think a bit of both”.
My tiredness had reached a level that sleep couldn’t fix, at least not until I’d taken a dip to clear my
head. I grabbed a swimsuit and ran to catch the beach before the flotsam of the cyclone made
landfall.
Little had changed since I was last in Tarawa, save for the trees growing taller, and a few more rigs.
But here and there I passed storm scars; a swathe of mangrove trees blown down, a houseraft run
aground, and everywhere people working hard to repair them. It seemed to me like the island’s
strength was not in its foundations of shifting sands, but in the communities that were holding it
together.
I stopped at a bathing pool by a honeycomb of floating houses, each with a roof garden and a
pontoon for tying up canoes.
I knew this spot well enough to dive in without looking. Pausing a moment to breathe in the
memories, I leaped and dived down, deep into the water, not caring in that reckless moment how far
from safety I may have strayed.
Suddenly something strong and smooth wrapped around my ankle and pulled me down. Thrashing
and kicking the thing away, in that blurry blue world I saw the tattooed legs and flippers disappear
in a burst of bubbles. Reaching the surface I gasped for air and faced my assailant. My fear-driven
anger melted away to slackjawed surprise.
It was Timon.
“Crocodile!” he shouted with a smile that extended wider than his face.
He circled me, his hands tracing the flock of swallows that extended from my right elbow to
between my shoulder blades. One bird for every 40,000 nautical miles. I was planning for them to
reach the other elbow, but plans could always be changed.
“How are you Gen? I see you’ve added a few more birds to the flock. You know swimming here
you have to watch out for sea kraits. Those snakes have gone crazy since the reef transplant.
They’re mainly a problem on land though. Don’t worry, I’ll go shake your clothes out for you.”
I followed him out of the water. As he pulled on a shirt, leaving it open at the front I noticed he’d
gained a new tattoo. It sat awkwardly, I thought, above the traditionally inked zigzag lines on his
torso; a desert island with two palm trees in garish bright colours, as if the island were levitating
over waves.
“I’m ok” I managed to reply. “Same old sea, passengers, cargo, Calista… And you? How is life in
Kiribati?”
“Life here is good and even better for seeing you.” He said, shooting me another warming smile.
“We’ve had some bad storms the last two years and had to dredge and rebuild three islands. One of
them was the Sponsor’s.”
“And they rebuilt his island first, right?”
“No, as a matter of fact she insisted we work on the other islands first”.
“Intriguing” I said. “Perhaps you could tell me about it over a drink?”.
Walking down the steps into the subterranean shade of the Bunker Bar, my eyes took a while to
adjust. The air was warm and musty with the scent of sweat and seafood.
Timon was talking animatedly, plucking ideas out of the air and gripping them between his hands.
The seawall project had expanded under new funding, he had been elected onto the council, and one
day he hoped to run for president.
We found a seat and ordered.
“Enough of politics. Tarawa is self-sufficient, but what happens to you at the next food shortage?”.
“Oh, we’re ok, what with mum’s microfarm and we’re now dabbling in mycology”.
“And insects?” he suggested, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Not yet! Though it beats me why eating mold is somehow more civilized than bugs. No, honestly,
we’re just one duck short of self-sufficiency”.
“That can be arranged” Timon laughed and slapped my arm. “Now I have a small favour to ask. A
boat of kids was picked up by a windjammer cruiseship a few weeks ago. Turns out the Marshall
Islands had a school washed away&hellip; I was wondering if you could take them home?”.
“Timon, I’d love to, but right now I can’t even pay my rent”.
“It sounds like you need a Sponsor!” Timon always had a solution.
“I’m sorry but I can’t take handouts from a Priv”.
“Privilege isn’t a bad thing if it’s used to do good. I should know, I’m engaged to a ‘Priv’! Honestly,
I think you’d like her”.
At these words I felt my heart burst open and flood upwards, choking in my throat.
“Actually I think you went freediving with her the last time you were here.” He added.
“Hang on&hellip; There’s no way Nauri is a Priv!”.
“Her father died two years ago, and it turns out he was very rich. Anyway, I have to run now. I have
a Council meeting. No more living on ‘island time’ I’m afraid”.
He stood up to leave and fixed me with his kind, dark eyes. “Like I said, I know a good Sponsor”.
I struggled to speak with so much bitterness to swallow.
“Well, I bet she doesn’t have an engagement tattoo across the middle of her chest.” I blurted out.
“No, she doesn’t&hellip;” He admitted, his lips curling, suppressing a thought. Then he leant in to
whisper “hers is somewhere else&hellip;”.
I watched him skip up the steps where the blinding sunlight was streaming in. It illuminated a
miniature Milky Way of dust that drifted slowly down to impact soundlessly on the sandy floor.
Then the young waiter arrived at the table with a plate of farmed tiger prawns. My mouth watered,
but what I wanted wasn’t on the menu. I sent it to the plastic harvester sat nearby, still in her
overalls, bags under her eyes as dark as the night she’d been working through.
“Get her a drink as well” I added as I pressed a bag of coffee beans into his hand and two stainless
steel teaspoons I’d dived from a wreck. He looked at me confused. “They can be melted down” I
explained, before heading out into the unforgiving midday sun.
The third day dawned calm and bright, and fair winds beckoned. Timon and Nauri had been in more
meetings but sent their regards.
“Welcome aboard&hellip;” I faltered in front of my blank-faced passengers, wondering if they were any
good at poker. “Please don’t touch any buttons”.
I paused again, trapped in the gaze of a dozen pairs of wide eyes, and a malevolent looking duck
whom I later named Lorenza.
“Oh, and especially don’t flush the toilet near land because it converts our waste into sea fertilizer,
simulating the flocculant of a blue whale.”
Eleven confused faces turned towards the tallest boy. “What she means is if you press this button
the boat will poo like a big fish”.
The eruption of laughter startled Lorenza, who flapped about and ejected her own fertilizer across
the deck, sending the kids hopping and shrieking after it.
“Calista, no more payments in water fowl”.
My mum laughed then too, tears glistening on her high cheekbones, and it reminded me that having
children aboard really wasn’t safe. But then again, nowhere ever was.</p>
<p>The small bookshop Taylor owned was closed, its solar lamp flicked pointedly off, but after several minutes of persistent knocking there was a loud squawk, and his co-owner Sam came to the door with a resigned sigh. “You didn’t have to wake up Darwin,” he muttered irritably, brightening a bit when he saw the albatross. Darwin, one of Crate’s few dodos, eyed her curiously, his collar jingling as he fluttered onto the coffee table to get a better look at the drone’s dissection.</p>
<h1 id="heading"></h1>
<p>“It’s not a net drone, oddly, though it looks like one,” Sam said at last, surveying the scraps. “It’s automata – back before the pureclones, some people tried to bring back extinct species through robot facsimiles. The rubberized vaquita were cute – not as realistic as the gen-mod versions, of course. But cute.” </p>
<p>A jealous beak jostled the table, and Sam reached down to stroke Darwin behind his collar. “You’re several strains away from a pureclone, beastie. More pigeon than anything,” he muttered, and Darwin puffed his chest feathers with pride before strutting into the kitchen to beg another piece of hydroponic seaweed.</p>
<p>“If it’s not a net drone, why is it set up like one?” Akila asked slowly. </p>
<p>Sam’s brow furrowed with a fear she could not place, but he said nothing. </p>
<h1 id="heading-1"></h1>
<p>Sam suspected that the drone was American in origin, and had veered wildly off course after a particularly gnarly hurricane that had flooded much of what remained of Florida. America was one of the few countries that still used the old automata builds, he knew from Taylor’s halcyon stories of the dog automata of his youth. Taylor always spoke of America fondly. It was as though he remembered only the cotton candy of his childhood 4th of July parades, and not the black-clad Vice police, the militarized crackdown against “riot boosting.” How each new storm was twisted into the wrath of an angry god, the way fear of the rising seas crept up from news chyrons to a choking, ever-present panic. As fires winked red eyes across the Western skies, strong men leaders rose like sea walls, promising to protect their flock from a new plague. Those who pushed back – who resisted the rush to blame – became blasphemous. </p>
<p>The economic aftershocks of the collapse of offshore oil – propped up heavily with subsidies – had been the first blow. Then, Mexico pulled out of the lucrative trade pacts that had kept drone-retailers headquartered in America’s port cities. Much of Silicon Valley, frustrated also by the new taxes on online transactions and so-called cultural purity standards for Internet fast lanes, moved offshore, settling into the new stilt cities of Southeast Asia and, eventually, floating cities like Crate as sea levels kept rising. </p>
<p>Driverless transport, once a novelty, had become the backbone of Mexico’s coastal economy, leaving its northern neighbor crumbling. And, as the unmanned barges and trucks and trains hummed silently across the globe, lonely Crate, once barely a speck of rust in the Indian Ocean, grew into an unlikely metropolis, a jostling and jovial mix of devout Sikhs and stateless Deists, Hindu refugees and renegade hipsters. Some, like Akila’s parents, were engineers who emigrated to tinker with the drone-barges that stopped by Crate for repairs, while others, like Taylor, had escaped the purges of President Cloud, </p>
<p>“It was like the wild west in the early days,” Taylor said absently. “When I first came, I was writing a story speculating on whether Crate would become one of those walled cities, a floating theocracy where nothing ever came in, and nothing ever went out. It was a pendulum back then, before Mayor Fawzia, and a slight push in either direction –”</p>
<p>“Ironically, America went isolationist first.” Sam sank into the couch beside his husband, leaning his head onto his shoulder. “Keep Crate weird, wasn’t that our slogan in the early days? It seems so long ago…” There was a long silence, broken only by a hydroponic hum, a fluorescent flickering as the solar lamps sputtered to life, and the city settled into twilight. </p>
<p>Akila had interned for Mayor Fawzia one summer, and she remembered the elderly Eritrean woman well, famed as she was for her fiery defense of citizenship for the stateless and the Albatross Autonomous Internet, the clamor against censorship that had come to define Crate’s destiny. Unlike the walled cities, Crate had turned outwards, embracing the castaways who clung to its churning wave energy converters and fashioned its first storm barriers out of plastic and broken bottles. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch and other offshore landfills had rapidly been subsumed in the desperate days when the floating cities were little more than rafts of tents, refugee camps forged by desperation. After decades of tense negotiation, the world’s superpowers at last proved unwilling to take in the millions who had relied on bleaching coral archipelagos. Instead, they set up the primitive hydrofreight refugee system as a compromise, and sent the starving out to sea with a few scattered packets of gen-mod seaweed.</p>
<p>Almost at once, tinkerers from around the world had begun prodding these curious patches of floating misery. From well-wishers around the world, in packages of every shape and size, came solar batteries and hydroponic waste treatment and algae generators and pieces of the first-generation storm stabilization systems, the ballasts and spherical barrier walls that had steadied Crate through many a tropical typhoon. Most of the heavy lifting was done by the residents themselves - refugees who forged a floating city where everyone knew every job and everyone. In the first few generations, fixing the barrier shields was done by hand, not by drone, and there was a monument on almost every street corner to those who had been lost in the perpetual struggle against the sea. Crate had been forced to flounder along on the revenue from seaweed farming for over a decade before finally settling into a steady suburban hum, a comfortable carpet of coffee shops and cloning start-ups. These far-flung gen-mod firms had later produced pigeon monstrosities like Darwin, who was currently hopping to and fro, sputtering indignantly at not being allowed on the couch.</p>
<p>Taylor patted him absently, and Darwin cooed, momentarily soothed. “At least the pureclones are friendly,” he muttered. “That – that thing on the table is not.” Sam shot him a glance.</p>
<p>“Should we tell her?”</p>
<p>Taylor sighed, settling back to stroke Darwin’s feathers. Within a few minutes the dodo was snoring on the rug.</p>
<p>“After the Third American Exclusion Act, President Cloud started a new crackdown. What you found was a propaganda drone – an ancient model, a bit like the net drones social networks used to send out in the old days, before the low-orbit satellites made that largely obsolete. Your bird here would have circled the states for thousands of miles without stopping, re-routing any signal it came in contact with.”</p>
<p>“A very old femtocell hack,” Sam said softly. “Not perfect, but fairly unpredictable, and if you get caught with something you shouldn’t…” Taylor shuddered. </p>
<p>“So it’s the opposite of our albatrosses? Fawzia’s Autonomous Internet?” Akila felt a warm sliver of indignation prickle across her chest. </p>
<p>Sam chuckled. “Technically, I think it’s supposed to be a bald eagle, but the paint wore off. Not much we can do, I’m afraid. If we fix the nav system, it might make it home. Otherwise, it’ll just make it to my scrap drawer. I might just build a new dodo to replace this one.” He nudged Darwin gently with one foot, and Darwin stirred in his sleep and rolled over, scaly feet clasped peacefully across his bulbous belly. </p>
<p>Taylor chuckled. “Let’s talk about something more pleasant. Tea?”</p>
<p> After a few more pleasantries, Akila stumbled out into the twilight, shivering as a fine mist drifted down from the barrier hull far above. A low growl echoed through the deserted streets as the barrier hulls tightened, the rings of metal curling like petals around the slumbering city after the sun went down. Drifting just east of Madagascar, President Cloud and his albatross seemed a world away.</p>
<h1 id="heading-2"></h1>
<p>For the next week the albatross circled ceaselessly through her thoughts, until at last Akila burst through the shop door, her face flushed, startling Sam and frightening Darwin. </p>
<p>“The campaign against Pinochet!” she gasped at last. Darwin cooed quizzically. “Cloud’s platform is all about fear, right? So you counter it with something saccharine, something fluffy and upbeat. Something the censors won’t expect.”</p>
<p>“The opposition can’t run ads, it isn’t allowed,” Taylor said tersely.</p>
<p>Akila sighed, exasperated. “You always say politics is a pendulum. So why not try to push it? Why not give the states a real choice for once?”</p>
<p>“I did try to push it, and it pushed me here,” Taylor snapped. “At least Cloud has one less drone now. What do you expect me to do?”</p>
<p> “Why not start with fixing the nav system?”</p>
<h1 id="heading-3"></h1>
<p>On the eve of the American election, the New Unity Party were facing down the American Lions, President Cloud’s party, and, as always, the Green Party, proudly clinging to 5.4% of the electorate. The Lions had long since switched to an online voting system, eliminating the former certification process - and a healthy swath of voter registrations - to ensure their continued limp to victory.  </p>
<p>At 8 p.m. sharp, President Cloud’s face flickered across every watch, display, and e-mug in America, promising a golden dawn of prosperity. And at 8:04 p.m. an undead albatross plunged into the heart of the Vice Ministry’s media hub, a targeted strike on the one zotta-processor through which all communications were routed.</p>
<p>The video they had chosen was more medley than montage, a slip-shod history that President Cloud denied existed. Flappers frolicked on Rockaway Beach before the New Jersey offshore drilling operation collapsed. Ticker tape fluttered through Times Square on V-Day, and piles of bananas and papayas glistened in supermarkets before the Tropical Fruit Embargo of 2025.  Bayard Rustin mapped out the March on Washington, fading into other marches, other speeches, a flipbook of all the pages the Vice Ministry had torn out of textbooks. Akila watched with bated breath as the first net drones went up, and Dorothy Vaughn smiled in crisp black and white. The U.N. Secretary General announced the creation of the hydrofreights. </p>
<p>The video sped up, flipping faster and faster from present to past. In the dizzying collage of photos and clippings was the full Fibonacci tree of futures, the endless branchings and re-branchings that led, however improbably, to President Cloud, to Crate, to a world of walls and albatrosses. She saw the floating cities built from scrap, the desperate scrabble for life as superpowers turned inwards. She saw two paths, spiraling out from one other, a world spread like a spider web across the sea, a state governed by the stateless, and a feudal, frightened world, circling ever inwards. She saw the end of history, and a choice in how it would end.</p>
<p>The first clusters of no votes appeared, glittering like stars, constellations that spun outward from a half dozen cities. The pendulum trembled, then began to tilt. The projection shivered, and when the image came back whole swathes of the map gleamed silver. </p>
<p>“Even if Cloud doesn’t concede they’ll know,” Sam said softly. “They see it now, even if they didn’t before.”</p>
<p>Shortly before midnight, the New Unity Party began lifting the censorship standards. And, ten thousand miles away, Fawzia’s albatrosses flew west on silent silver wings, bringing good luck for a new century.</p>
