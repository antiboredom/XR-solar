            Maïa climbs up the ladder and tries to sit next to me with as little noise as possible.<br />“You’re late,”
            I mutter, and it comes out more annoyed than I am.<br />“I know,” she whispers, crossing her legs on the
            sandwood boards to my mat, as she has<br />forgotten hers again.<br />We stare at the landscape before us, a
            hand risen up to our faces, covering the left eye. Our<br />right eye is fixed on that jagged line of
            mountain crests on the horizon, where the purple<br />haze is shifting into a warm peach light.<br />And the
            sun rises.<br />We sit in perfect silence while the forest stretches and welcomes daylight in a concert
            of<br />sounds and songs. Little steps of solitary walks populate the ground below us, chirping and<br />tweeting
            messengers perform test flights in the new light of the day all around. We don’t<br />glance nor move.
            Although we can’t see it, we feel the leaves rising all around the treehouse,<br />the long breath of their
            night starting its slow release. Liquid warmth embraces our bodies<br />when the light reaches us, entering
            undisturbed through the wall-high open window,<br />reaching all angles of our one-room refuge.<br />It
            lasts no more than a couple of minutes. Then just as the new bird gathers courage and<br />sets off the
            nest, the burning golden disc detaches itself from the horizon, and having<br />assured this, we’re free to
            go. We lower our hands.<br />Maïa yawns loudly over her own words. “Are you ready? D-did you sleep at all? I
            didn’t,”<br />she stutters excitedly, “Moms say it’s normal but I thought what if I don’t have the energy<br />to
            walk all the way to the hermitage? Do you know how far it is? It can’t be that far, no?”<br />“Give me a
            break. You’re ten, not eighty, Maïa.” I exhale, stretch my neck, turn my eyes to<br />her. The black round
            spot the sun has left on my eye casts its holy shadow wherever I look. I get up, grab my bag, and begin the
            descent. Maïa follows, chatting happily in whispers. We get back to the Nook from behind the market, and get
            in line with the others who are also coming back for breakfast from the salute. Maïa runs to Mel, Deirdre
            and Cleo for a hug.<br />“One day I’ll figure out where you do the Hatching every day, little ones!”
            threatens Mel<br />pointing at us with a smile. “Are you coming for breakfast, Elion?”<br />“We’re going to
            their place,” replies Maïa, grabbing my arm. “See you later!”<br />“We’ll see you at the hermitage, little
            ones.”<br />Maïa gasps. “You don’t come with us?”<br /><br />“You’re too many this year, you’re going on
            your own,” explains Deirdre. “Come on, give a<br />kiss to mums and go.” They wave goodbye to us as we
            leave.<br />“Why do you keep inviting yourself?” I complain to Maïa on the way to the cottage.<br />“Today
            there’s a pretty good reason, you monkey” she protests. “I want to talk with your<br />mum again before
            leaving. She was a Singer too, no? Maybe she’s finally going to tell us<br />more.”<br />“She didn’t for the
            past two weeks you’ve been asking her…”<br />“Maybe she was waiting for today.”<br />Dad is arranging
            strawberries and honey on the table outside, next to our vegetable garden.<br />Mum is there too, picking up
            the rhubarb for tonight. The extra plate for Maïa is already<br />there. Dad hugs me, scratches the short
            hair on my nape. “Feeling ready?”<br />I shrug, while Maïa is already answering on behalf of both of us. “I
            am for sure,” she lies, “I<br />don’t know about Elion, they’ve been suspiciously silent all morning, so I
            think they’re<br />trying to play cool, and they’re actually terrified.”<br />I throw a strawberry at her
            face. She catches it with her mouth and winks at me, undefeated.<br />The bags we bring to the hermitage are
            empty but for the water from our homes. The<br />group walks on steadily, with nervous but happy chatting
            all along the queue. We’re all<br />about the same age, two years more or two years less. The Pham twins are
            the youngest,<br />seven years old. We went to school together. Their family is the only other family
            beside<br />mine and Maïa’s that practices the Hatching. When their little brother was born, we prayed<br />together.
            I reach them. Niwa is dreamy as always, Koi is staring at the back of our guide.<br />The old lady walks
            first, following the path. Her blouse leaves her shoulders and part of her<br />back bare. And there, her
            wrinkly black skin is covered in the pale pink tattoo of a<br />blossoming peach tree.<br />“I want a peach
            tree too,” murmurs Koi. “Did your mum say anything about how to get the<br />one we want?”<br />“We
            can’t.”<br />“Of course we can’t, you silly!” giggles Niwa. “There are millions of trees, plants,<br />vegetables…
            What are the odds of you getting the one you feel for?”<br />“Well, I want something with fruit,” states Koi
            stubbornly.<br />“And I’d like something that grows under the ground, in the warmth of the soil. You?”<br />I
            bite my lips. I don’t want to say it. “I don’t know.”<br />I don’t want to say I want to go away.<br /><br />The
            twins stop paying attention to me quite quickly. The forest is dark and deep and<br />there’s plenty to get
            distracted with. Our little eyes examine one by one the pulsating green<br />life that surrounds us,
            wondering secretly if any of the shapes we are looking at now will one<br />day grow on the blank of our
            skin.<br />At the edge of the flat where we come from, a big crack in the forest opens on a canyon.<br />Down
            below, Beam city extends from the very narrow start of the crack up until where the<br />canyon ends at the
            edge of the flat, and the desert begins. Most of us have come here already,<br />although never by crossing
            the woods - it’s about ten minutes with the Shinkansen, not the<br />two hour walk we just had. We descend
            using wooden cabins, in groups of five. The city is<br />beautiful from up here. And there, right in the
            middle of the canyon, just like a tower, the<br />massive rock of the hermitage rises above everything else.
            The city woods around it gets<br />denser, and the shining rooftops of the city become more and more rare as
            you get closer.<br />Maïa shakes me by the arm. “Can you see it?”<br />“Of course I can,” I grumble. The
            hermitage is up there. Built in the lone rock. The caves<br />were covered in wood and glass, with the trees
            that grow hanging on the sides of the rock,<br />defying gravity with meters of void under their roots,
            mixing seamlessly with the<br />construction.<br />While we walk in the city, people stare and smile at us.
            Some of them wish us good luck. A<br />lady in dungarees points to the large green leaves covering her
            shoulder blades like wings<br />and tells us she hopes to find new water lilies among us. Maïa is all proud
            and says hi to<br />everyone. As we proceed towards the hermitage rock, houses are smaller and smaller,
            until<br />we reach a short cobble path. “Here we go again,” comments Koi next to me. He powers up<br />the
            titanium implant of his right leg. We start climbing up. A sound of water comes from<br />somewhere close.
            Beam city is full of streams and creeks. They come from the caves at the<br />beginning of the valley: from
            there, the water runs down towards the desert and then, right<br />before the end of the valley, it dives
            underground. The Waterway, they call it - mum came<br />from there. The underground river goes on for miles
            and miles, feeding the towns of the<br />people of the desert. Beam city makes sure that water is safe. And
            the desert towns, in<br />partnership, sun-power the entire Beam city with their desert energy. The bamboo
            steps<br />we’re climbing now run all around the rock, and as we turn towards the south, there it is:<br />the
            shining red dunes of my mum’s homeland.<br />Maïa is tormenting the tip of her braid. “Will it hurt?”<br /><br />Her
            voice is so low. She doesn’t want anyone to hear.<br />“It doesn’t. Mum said it’s like a mosquito bite,” I
            lie. “The first tattoo is so small. The ones<br />you do after, as you grow up, take more time, but then
            you’re already older and stronger,<br />right?”<br />In truth, I didn’t ask mum if it hurts. I didn’t want
            her to know I’m scared too.<br />Maïa sighs in relief. And in that moment, the Singer of Seeds steps in.<br />We
            gather in silence around her. She’s small, and way, way younger than we all expected.<br />She’s smiling,
            allowing us to contemplate her tattoo. Sturdy and thick, the branches of the<br />willow extend to her
            shoulders, around her neck, down to her arms until the fingertips,<br />bright green, while her legs are
            covered in wrinkly roots.<br />“Six hundred years ago,” begins the story we all know.<br />Six hundred years
            ago, after the second great collapse, the people of the flat secured all the<br />seeds they could find in a
            bunker underground. While war ravaged the land, six families<br />held onto the secret of the hermitage’s
            location, surviving everything, sacrificing everything,<br />for it to be found again when time was due. And
            only when time was due, only then, they<br />gathered their people and shared the sacred treasure of the
            seeds.<br />And that’s how humanity survived.<br />“You shall receive one seed,” she recites. “The living
            being that will come from it shall be<br />your companion for life. Wherever you’ll see one, you shall be
            protected; whenever you’ll<br />see one, you shall protect it.” Her words have begun to have music in them
            without us<br />noticing exactly when. The massive gear behind her has started rotating, and the movement<br />ignited
            by the sound of her voice seems to dictate the rhythm and direction of all the glass<br />wheels within it.
            Thousands and thousands of tiny boxes flash indistinguishably before our<br />eyes. “You shall return the
            seed you have been given before the end of your cycle under this<br />sun, together with another one of that
            same species. You shall carry the seed with you,<br />marked in your skin, growing strong just as you
            grow.”<br />The players sitting at the edge of the chamber have started playing. Flutes and drums echo<br />vigorously
            through the arches on top of us, all the way to the top of the opening of the cave<br />above our heads,
            stronger than any sound I’ve heard before in my life.<br />“Let the song begin.”<br />All in one, we sing.
            There are no words in what we’re singing; or some do say something,<br />it’s not easy to understand. One by
            one, we step towards the Singer of Seeds, and one by<br />one her voice tunes into ours, and just for an
            instant, right then, the wheel stops spinning,<br />and quick as thunder the Singer picks the box it’s
            stopped on, and gives it to us. There’s<br />hope in our voices; there’s the vision of a planet that is ours
            as much as we are its own. Thebox in my hands has something that looks like cotton inside, and a tiny,
            diamond-shaped<br />dark drop at the center of it, barely visible. Later, very soon, the Inkmaster will turn
            that<br />shape into the founding point of a tattoo that one day will cover my body. And while my<br />voice
            keeps singing, I daydream of islands far in the ocean, and a path that unfolds in front<br />of me, away
            from everything I already know, away to places where people are not marked by seeds, where they don’t
            welcome the Hatching of a phoenix every morning, where perhaps<br />there’s sand and underground life just
            like where my mother is from, or where there’s ice,<br />ice I’ve never seen. I daydream of the people of
            the mountains in the north and their trains<br />that run on water, I see their glider highways and the ice
            storages on the peaks. The diggers<br />of the steppe we receive calls from every winter, unearthing the
            history of our culture and<br />rebuilding what’s worth rebuilding in there before sending it out for
            testing all round the<br />world, moving fast from camp to camp on the rides they choose as lifetime
            companions,<br />fierce animals they have many different names for. And I see the engineers, flying from<br />continent
            to continent on the helium pulsars, wiring up the technology that allows us to<br />see all of these, and
            stay connected to all our loved ones everywhere, in a second.<br />I’ll be there.<br />All of that, I’ll
            see. Running after a seed that will take me to impossible places to find<br />another alike. Exploring and
            mapping until my mission is complete, while my tattoo<br />unfolds on my back as I learn, and grow, and
            become someone of my own.<br />Our song ends in a single heartbeat. We sit in perfect silence and place the
            box in front of us.<br />I open mine. A little tag reads the name of my ticket to the outside world.<br />It’s
            a rhubarb.

            first, following the path. Her blouse leaves her shoulders and part of her<br />back bare. And there, her
            wrinkly black skin is covered in the pale pink tattoo of a<br />blossoming peach tree.<br />“I want a peach
            tree too,” murmurs Koi. “Did your mum say anything about how to get the<br />one we want?”<br />“We
            can’t.”<br />“Of course we can’t, you silly!” giggles Niwa. “There are millions of trees, plants,<br />vegetables…
            What are the odds of you getting the one you feel for?”<br />“Well, I want something with fruit,” states Koi
            stubbornly.<br />“And I’d like something that grows under the ground, in the warmth of the soil. You?”<br />I
            bite my lips. I don’t want to say it. “I don’t know.”<br />I don’t want to say I want to go away.<br /><br />The
            twins stop paying attention to me quite quickly. The forest is dark and deep and<br />there’s plenty to get
            distracted with. Our little eyes examine one by one the pulsating green<br />life that surrounds us,
            wondering secretly if any of the shapes we are looking at now will one<br />day grow on the blank of our
            skin.<br />At the edge of the flat where we come from, a big crack in the forest opens on a canyon.<br />Down
            below, Beam city extends from the very narrow start of the crack up until where the<br />canyon ends at the
            edge of the flat, and the desert begins. Most of us have come here already,<br />although never by crossing
            the woods - it’s about ten minutes with the Shinkansen, not the<br />two hour walk we just had. We descend
            using wooden cabins, in groups of five. The city is<br />beautiful from up here. And there, right in the
            middle of the canyon, just like a tower, the<br />massive rock of the hermitage rises above everything else.
            The city woods around it gets<br />denser, and the shining rooftops of the city become more and more rare as
            you get closer.<br />Maïa shakes me by the arm. “Can you see it?”<br />“Of course I can,” I grumble. The
            hermitage is up there. Built in the lone rock. The caves<br />were covered in wood and glass, with the trees
            that grow hanging on the sides of the rock,<br />defying gravity with meters of void under their roots,
            mixing seamlessly with the<br />construction.<br />While we walk in the city, people stare and smile at us.
            Some of them wish us good luck. A<br />lady in dungarees points to the large green leaves covering her
            shoulder blades like wings<br />and tells us she hopes to find new water lilies among us. Maïa is all proud
            and says hi to<br />everyone. As we proceed towards the hermitage rock, houses are smaller and smaller,
            until<br />we reach a short cobble path. “Here we go again,” comments Koi next to me. He powers up<br />the
            titanium implant of his right leg. We start climbing up. A sound of water comes from<br />somewhere close.
            Beam city is full of streams and creeks. They come from the caves at the<br />beginning of the valley: from
            there, the water runs down towards the desert and then, right<br />before the end of the valley, it dives
            underground. The Waterway, they call it - mum came<br />from there. The underground river goes on for miles
            and miles, feeding the towns of the<br />people of the desert. Beam city makes sure that water is safe. And
            the desert towns, in<br />partnership, sun-power the entire Beam city with their desert energy. The bamboo
            steps<br />we’re climbing now run all around the rock, and as we turn towards the south, there it is:<br />the
            shining red dunes of my mum’s homeland.<br />Maïa is tormenting the tip of her braid. “Will it hurt?”<br /><br />Her
            voice is so low. She doesn’t want anyone to hear.<br />“It doesn’t. Mum said it’s like a mosquito bite,” I
            lie. “The first tattoo is so small. The ones<br />you do after, as you grow up, take more time, but then
            you’re already older and stronger,<br />right?”<br />In truth, I didn’t ask mum if it hurts. I didn’t want
            her to know I’m scared too.<br />Maïa sighs in relief. And in that moment, the Singer of Seeds steps in.<br />We
            gather in silence around her. She’s small, and way, way younger than we all expected.<br />She’s smiling,
            allowing us to contemplate her tattoo. Sturdy and thick, the branches of the<br />willow extend to her
            shoulders, around her neck, down to her arms until the fingertips,<br />bright green, while her legs are
            covered in wrinkly roots.<br />“Six hundred years ago,” begins the story we all know.<br />Six hundred years
            ago, after the second great collapse, the people of the flat secured all the<br />seeds they could find in a
            bunker underground. While war ravaged the land, six families<br />held onto the secret of the hermitage’s
            location, surviving everything, sacrificing everything,<br />for it to be found again when time was due. And
            only when time was due, only then, they<br />gathered their people and shared the sacred treasure of the
            seeds.<br />And that’s how humanity survived.<br />“You shall receive one seed,” she recites. “The living
            being that will come from it shall be<br />your companion for life. Wherever you’ll see one, you shall be
            protected; whenever you’ll<br />see one, you shall protect it.” Her words have begun to have music in them
            without us<br />noticing exactly when. The massive gear behind her has started rotating, and the movement<br />ignited
            by the sound of her voice seems to dictate the rhythm and direction of all the glass<br />wheels within it.
            Thousands and thousands of tiny boxes flash indistinguishably before our<br />eyes. “You shall return the
            seed you have been given before the end of your cycle under this<br />sun, together with another one of that
            same species. You shall carry the seed with you,<br />marked in your skin, growing strong just as you
            grow.”<br />The players sitting at the edge of the chamber have started playing. Flutes and drums echo<br />vigorously
            through the arches on top of us, all the way to the top of the opening of the cave<br />above our heads,
            stronger than any sound I’ve heard before in my life.<br />“Let the song begin.”<br />All in one, we sing.
            There are no words in what we’re singing; or some do say something,<br />it’s not easy to understand. One by
            one, we step towards the Singer of Seeds, and one by<br />one her voice tunes into ours, and just for an
            instant, right then, the wheel stops spinning,<br />and quick as thunder the Singer picks the box it’s
            stopped on, and gives it to us. There’s<br />hope in our voices; there’s the vision of a planet that is ours
            as much as we are its own. The<br />box in my hands has something that looks like cotton inside, and a tiny,
            diamond-shaped<br />dark drop at the center of it, barely visible. Later, very soon, the Inkmaster will turn
            that<br />shape into the founding point of a tattoo that one day will cover my body. And while my<br />voice
            keeps singing, I daydream of islands far in the ocean, and a path that unfolds in front<br />of me, away
            from everything I already know, away to places where people are not marked by<br />seeds, where they don’t
            welcome the Hatching of a phoenix every morning, where perhaps<br />there’s sand and underground life just
            like where my mother is from, or where there’s ice,<br />ice I’ve never seen. I daydream of the people of
            the mountains in the north and their trains<br />that run on water, I see their glider highways and the ice
            storages on the peaks. The diggers<br />of the steppe we receive calls from every winter, unearthing the
            history of our culture and<br />rebuilding what’s worth rebuilding in there before sending it out for
            testing all round the<br />world, moving fast from camp to camp on the rides they choose as lifetime
            companions,<br />fierce animals they have many different names for. And I see the engineers, flying from<br />continent
            to continent on the helium pulsars, wiring up the technology that allows us to<br />see all of these, and
            stay connected to all our loved ones everywhere, in a second.<br />I’ll be there.<br />All of that, I’ll
            see. Running after a seed that will take me to impossible places to find<br />another alike. Exploring and
            mapping until my mission is complete, while my tattoo<br />unfolds on my back as I learn, and grow, and
            become someone of my own.<br />Our song ends in a single heartbeat. We sit in perfect silence and place the
            box in front of us.<br />I open mine. A little tag reads the name of my ticket to the outside world.<br />It’s
            a rhubarb.

            Maïa climbs up the ladder and tries to sit next to me with as little noise as possible.<br />“You’re late,”
            I mutter, and it comes out more annoyed than I am.<br />“I know,” she whispers, crossing her legs on the
            sandwood boards to my mat, as she has<br />forgotten hers again.<br />We stare at the landscape before us, a
            hand risen up to our faces, covering the left eye. Our<br />right eye is fixed on that jagged line of
            mountain crests on the horizon, where the purple<br />haze is shifting into a warm peach light.<br />And the
            sun rises.<br />We sit in perfect silence while the forest stretches and welcomes daylight in a concert
            of<br />sounds and songs. Little steps of solitary walks populate the ground below us, chirping and<br />tweeting
            messengers perform test flights in the new light of the day all around. We don’t<br />glance nor move.
            Although we can’t see it, we feel the leaves rising all around the treehouse,<br />the long breath of their
            night starting its slow release. Liquid warmth embraces our bodies<br />when the light reaches us, entering
            undisturbed through the wall-high open window,<br />reaching all angles of our one-room refuge.<br />It
            lasts no more than a couple of minutes. Then just as the new bird gathers courage and<br />sets off the
            nest, the burning golden disc detaches itself from the horizon, and having<br />assured this, we’re free to
            go. We lower our hands.<br />Maïa yawns loudly over her own words. “Are you ready? D-did you sleep at all? I
            didn’t,”<br />she stutters excitedly, “Moms say it’s normal but I thought what if I don’t have the energy<br />to
            walk all the way to the hermitage? Do you know how far it is? It can’t be that far, no?”<br />“Give me a
            break. You’re ten, not eighty, Maïa.” I exhale, stretch my neck, turn my eyes to<br />her. The black round
            spot the sun has left on my eye casts its holy shadow wherever I look. I<br />get up, grab my bag, and begin
            the descent. Maïa follows, chatting happily in whispers. We<br />get back to the Nook from behind the
            market, and get in line with the others who are also<br />coming back for breakfast from the salute. Maïa
            runs to Mel, Deirdre and Cleo for a hug.<br />“One day I’ll figure out where you do the Hatching every day,
            little ones!” threatens Mel<br />pointing at us with a smile. “Are you coming for breakfast, Elion?”<br />“We’re
            going to their place,” replies Maïa, grabbing my arm. “See you later!”<br />“We’ll see you at the hermitage,
            little ones.”<br />Maïa gasps. “You don’t come with us?”<br /><br />“You’re too many this year, you’re going
            on your own,” explains Deirdre. “Come on, give a<br />kiss to mums and go.” They wave goodbye to us as we
            leave.<br />“Why do you keep inviting yourself?” I complain to Maïa on the way to the cottage.<br />“Today
            there’s a pretty good reason, you monkey” she protests. “I want to talk with your<br />mum again before
            leaving. She was a Singer too, no? Maybe she’s finally going to tell us<br />more.”<br />“She didn’t for the
            past two weeks you’ve been asking her…”<br />“Maybe she was waiting for today.”<br />Dad is arranging
            strawberries and honey on the table outside, next to our vegetable garden.<br />Mum is there too, picking up
            the rhubarb for tonight. The extra plate for Maïa is already<br />there. Dad hugs me, scratches the short
            hair on my nape. “Feeling ready?”<br />I shrug, while Maïa is already answering on behalf of both of us. “I
            am for sure,” she lies, “I<br />don’t know about Elion, they’ve been suspiciously silent all morning, so I
            think they’re<br />trying to play cool, and they’re actually terrified.”<br />I throw a strawberry at her
            face. She catches it with her mouth and winks at me, undefeated.<br />The bags we bring to the hermitage are
            empty but for the water from our homes. The<br />group walks on steadily, with nervous but happy chatting
            all along the queue. We’re all<br />about the same age, two years more or two years less. The Pham twins are
            the youngest,<br />seven years old. We went to school together. Their family is the only other family
            beside<br />mine and Maïa’s that practices the Hatching. When their little brother was born, we prayed<br />together.

            seed you have been given before the end of your cycle under this<br />sun, together with another one of that
            same species. You shall carry the seed with you,<br />marked in your skin, growing strong just as you
            grow.”<br />The players sitting at the edge of the chamber have started playing. Flutes and drums echo<br />vigorously
            through the arches on top of us, all the way to the top of the opening of the cave<br />above our heads,
            stronger than any sound I’ve heard before in my life.<br />“Let the song begin.”<br />All in one, we sing.
            There are no words in what we’re singing; or some do say something,<br />it’s not easy to understand. One by
            one, we step towards the Singer of Seeds, and one by<br />one her voice tunes into ours, and just for an
            instant, right then, the wheel stops spinning,<br />and quick as thunder the Singer picks the box it’s
            stopped on, and gives it to us. There’s<br />hope in our voices; there’s the vision of a planet that is ours
            as much as we are its own. The<br />box in my hands has something that looks like cotton inside, and a tiny,
            diamond-shaped<br />dark drop at the center of it, barely visible. Later, very soon, the Inkmaster will turn
            that<br />shape into the founding point of a tattoo that one day will cover my body. And while my<br />voice
            keeps singing, I daydream of islands far in the ocean, and a path that unfolds in front<br />of me, away
            from everything I already know, away to places where people are not marked by<br />seeds, where they don’t
            welcome the Hatching of a phoenix every morning, where perhaps<br />there’s sand and underground life just
            like where my mother is from, or where there’s ice,<br />ice I’ve never seen. I daydream of the people of
            the mountains in the north and their trains<br />that run on water, I see their glider highways and the ice
            storages on the peaks. The diggers<br />of the steppe we receive calls from every winter, unearthing the
            history of our culture and<br />rebuilding what’s worth rebuilding in there before sending it out for
            testing all round the<br />world, moving fast from camp to camp on the rides they choose as lifetime
            companions,<br />fierce animals they have many different names for. And I see the engineers, flying from<br />continent
            to continent on the helium pulsars, wiring up the technology that allows us to<br />see all of these, and
            stay connected to all our loved ones everywhere, in a second.<br />I’ll be there.<br />All of that, I’ll
            see. Running after a seed that will take me to impossible places to find<br />another alike. Exploring and
            mapping until my mission is complete, while my tattoo<br />unfolds on my back as I learn, and grow, and
            become someone of my own.<br />Our song ends in a single heartbeat. We sit in perfect silence and place the
            box in front of us.<br />I open mine. A little tag reads the name of my ticket to the outside world.<br />It’s
            a rhubarb.
