The aliens below them could hardly reach the edge of their own solar system in the span of one of their lifetimes, let alone visit others. Still, the pulse from a nuclear detonation was quite sufficient to interrupt their zero-point gravity drive, and the only thing worse than crashing into an alien planet was crashing into a freshly-grown radioactive hellscape.</p>
<p>“No need to worry,” replied Grey, “it’s been a while since they shot at anyone.” “At least they have radio,” said Blue, tuning in to the frequencies.</p>
