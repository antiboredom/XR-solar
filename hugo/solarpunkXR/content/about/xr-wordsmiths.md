We are a band/collective of writers who are deeply concerned with the climate and ecological emergency facing us all. We are a part of [Extinction Rebellion](https://rebellion.global/), and hail from all over the world.

Our writing is one way we battle against this emergency— we hope it spurs curiosity, concern, inspiration, reflection, love, rage, and also action. 

Check out the [XR Wordsmiths blog](https://xrwordsmiths.wordpress.com/blog/), where you’ll find all kinds of writing and a diversity of voices and styles, to remind us of the diversity of humankind and our beautiful living earth. We are always looking for new voices.
