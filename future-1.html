            Nowadays, students do not enjoy school much because it is boring. So a lot of teachers are determined to
            make the school a fun place, while keeping it safe and eco-friendly. But how? We’ll find out!<br /><br />Outside
            there will be an invisible protection zone, when you want to go to the school there will be fingerprint
            recognition to check if it is you, also there will be a hand sanitizer inside.<br /><br />Most people like
            it when pets play around them. Students always hope that they can bring their pets to school because they
            feel sad to say goodbye to their pets every day when they have to go to school. And now, students can bring
            pets to school, and get them back after school, and also they can play with them during break time. Pets can
            be sent to the pet school, there will be a lot of trainers and they can train them to sit or lay and even
            teach them to become friends with other animals! There are a lot more. Pet school provides water, treats,
            baths, and beds for them to sleep. When they have to pee or poop, there will be a paper pad for them. When
            they want to play, they can play with one another.<br /><br />Now we have to go to the classroom, there is a
            teleportation stand next to the entrance for each class, you just have to stand on your class teleportation
            stand, and you will arrive at the classroom in a second! But it tickles when you teleport and you feel like
            you are yanked up, if you move, it won’t work.&nbsp;&nbsp;So a lot of people failed to make it to the
            classroom on time.<br /><br />In the center of the classroom, desks are floating. The biggest one is the
            teacher’s desk, the other floating desks are for the students. On the teacher’s desk, there is a small pen,
            it allows you to write in the air! The student’s desk has an accelerator and a brake so it looks and works
            like an automobile so you can play with it during the break.<br />And students don’t need to have homework,
            because they do all the work on their 3D projector. It explains how to do all the homework, so if you don’t
            understand something, you can always ask it for some guidance to finish the workbook at school. In our
            school, there will be a lot of paper savings. For the paper-saving part, we will try to use as much
            technology as possible, now we use paper to write our homework, but in my school, they will use iPads
            instead of paper so we won’t have to worry about wasting too much paper.<br /><br />Now is time for lunch!
            Welcome to the cafeteria. You don’t see anything except a robot in the center only, it cooks everything!
            Including BBQ and peanut butter sandwiches, pasta, boiled vegetables, etc… They are all cruelty-free. There
            are some microphones, you order through them. After you eat, the robot will clean your plates and silverware
            without wasting too much water. Cool, right? Well, I think so.<br /><br />Next is Physical Education time!
            The gym has an underwater racing track, you and your friends can race with mini underwater motorcycles.
            There is also a climbing wall, and a trampoline basketball court! If people get hungry or thirsty during PE
            class, packets of water and fruit will be served.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a proper pool for you to swim in, it
            has a place to log your body condition, so it can recommend you an appropriate workout to make sure that you
            won’t get hurt in the pool. It also has a towel generator to supply you with towels, and also a toy
            generator for you to play on the water. In one semester, there will be one or two classes to let kids who
            are not disabled go around in a wheelchair to let them experience and respect disabled kids.<br /><br />Ringggggg!!!!!
            It is break time! Ya~ The first thing you see is the zipline, there is a house like a cart, it can hold two
            people, there are two chairs nailed to the ground, and a table, you can admire the scenes or read your book,
            I promise you will find your own fun there! Next, there is a horse riding area. The horses are mechanical
            but look real, except that they have lines that glow whatever color you want! There is a skydiving place,
            you have to take an elevator to the top and there are robots to help you wear the equipment and a parachute,
            and then you are ready to go! There is a drifting river you can float on, etc……..<br /><br />Next is nature
            class! In nature class, you will learn to grow plants and food in a garden. And we will avoid eating meat
            because killing animals will stop the circle of life. And one day, pigs, chickens, cows, ducks, etc will go
            into extinction. And there will be no more animals. We will also save water, when it is time to go home the
            teachers will go around the classroom asking if any students have any water left in their water bottles then
            the teachers will take the water to the garden and pour it in the dirt where the food grows to water it, we
            are doing that to replace all the water that you use to water a garden. And we will have a class or two
            about the importance of saving water and paper. And paper comes from trees, and trees help make the air
            fresher. So to save trees, you can start a petition about saving trees, and get people to sign it. And turn
            it into the government.<br /><br />Next up is cooking class. These days, a lot of people think that cooking
            is the girl’s job, but the men also need to learn how to cook because if they are single and not so rich,
            they have to cook for themselves. They will also use the vegetables and herbs to make delicious dishes! This
            helps them sort of prepare for their future.<br />Everyone loves field trips! So the field trips will
            continue but the bus is made of glass and it can go on and under the water, fly, and go into space and even
            land on other planets! Of course, it can drive on land! It looks like a whale shark when it is underwater,
            isn’t it cool? It looks like a bird when it flies! No one is driving the bus, instead, a robot controls it
            by using the steering wheel. When it’s in the air it uses wind power, when it’s underwater, it uses water
            power! Cool, right?<br /><br />So that is the future school of my design! If I can rate this school, I will
            give it 100!

            class, packets of water and fruit will be served.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a proper pool for you to swim in, it
            has a place to log your body condition, so it can recommend you an appropriate workout to make sure that you
            won’t get hurt in the pool. It also has a towel generator to supply you with towels, and also a toy
            generator for you to play on the water. In one semester, there will be one or two classes to let kids who
            are not disabled go around in a wheelchair to let them experience and respect disabled kids.<br /><br />Ringggggg!!!!!
            It is break time! Ya~ The first thing you see is the zipline, there is a house like a cart, it can hold two
            people, there are two chairs nailed to the ground, and a table, you can admire the scenes or read your book,
            I promise you will find your own fun there! Next, there is a horse riding area. The horses are mechanical
            but look real, except that they have lines that glow whatever color you want! There is a skydiving place,
            you have to take an elevator to the top and there are robots to help you wear the equipment and a parachute,
            and then you are ready to go! There is a drifting river you can float on, etc……..<br /><br />Next is nature
            class! In nature class, you will learn to grow plants and food in a garden. And we will avoid eating meat
            because killing animals will stop the circle of life. And one day, pigs, chickens, cows, ducks, etc will go
            into extinction. And there will be no more animals. We will also save water, when it is time to go home the
            teachers will go around the classroom asking if any students have any water left in their water bottles then
            the teachers will take the water to the garden and pour it in the dirt where the food grows to water it, we
            are doing that to replace all the water that you use to water a garden. And we will have a class or two
            about the importance of saving water and paper. And paper comes from trees, and trees help make the air
            fresher. So to save trees, you can start a petition about saving trees, and get people to sign it. And turn
            it into the government.<br /><br />Next up is cooking class. These days, a lot of people think that cooking
            is the girl’s job, but the men also need to learn how to cook because if they are single and not so rich,
            they have to cook for themselves. They will also use the vegetables and herbs to make delicious dishes! This
            helps them sort of prepare for their future.<br />Everyone loves field trips! So the field trips will
            continue but the bus is made of glass and it can go on and under the water, fly, and go into space and even
            land on other planets! Of course, it can drive on land! It looks like a whale shark when it is underwater,
            isn’t it cool? It looks like a bird when it flies! No one is driving the bus, instead, a robot controls it
            by using the steering wheel. When it’s in the air it uses wind power, when it’s underwater, it uses water
            power! Cool, right?<br /><br />So that is the future school of my design! If I can rate this school, I will
            give it 100!
