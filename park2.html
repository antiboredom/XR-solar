            The child’s face was cold, with a coating of frost and an icicle hanging off the end of her chin.<br /><br />The
            sun glinted off her forehead in fits and starts as it peeked through the clouds, but it was too little to
            warm her.<br /><br />It was January, after all, and it had been a cloudy winter.<br /><br />Jules always cut
            through the park on her way to work, but she liked it best this time of year. She liked the way the sun made
            the patches of snow seem to be illuminated from below in the early morning burst of colour. She liked the
            way her breath misted out and up into the sky, a sign of life in the still and frozen world. Few people were
            out walking, meaning she had it more or less to herself.<br /><br />The centrepiece of the park was the
            statue. The statue of the little girl. Violent hunks of metal jutting out in different directions as if it
            had burst through the ground, as if the earth itself had lashed out in anger.<br /><br /><br />And in the
            middle: the girl. The girl with the pleading look and the outstretched hand begging for it to stop. It. All
            of it.<br /><br />The statue had been installed in the dark of night nearly two decades earlier, placed by a
            group of parents who’d lost children. Lost them to floods. Lost them to fires. Lost them to asthma attacks.
            Lost them to bad water, bad storms, bad drivers who didn’t see the children playing.<br /><br />Lost them to
            the rush of society, unwilling to pause, to stop, to see what it was doing.<br /><br />The authorities said
            they’d remove it by the end of the week.<br /><br />But then people started coming.<br /><br />The first one
            came around lunchtime, leaving a photo of her son, age 5. He’d been swept away in the floodwaters following
            a hurricane a couple of years earlier. Later, another, bringing flowers and a child’s teddy. Then more. And
            more.<br /><br />There was the old man who left a photo of a family of five and a bulbous piece of mangled
            glass and stone. He’d lost his son, daughter-in-law, and three grandchildren when fires swept through their
            town out west. They’d been in their car trying to escape when the fires suddenly changed direction and
            overtook them. The glass was all that was left, the melted remains of an ornament he’d given them for the
            dashboard of their car. Something for them to remember him by, and which now served to remind him of
            them.<br /><br />He’d come when he saw the memorial on the news. As did so many others.<br /><br />When city
            workers finally arrived to remove the statue three days later, the crowd had grown, as had the remembrances.
            Photos, flowers, toys, cards, young and old, they all stretched out from the statue in a swirl of grief.
            Assembly and assemblage, alone and together.<br /><br />Jules had been a little girl, just 4 at the time,
            but she remembered the moment. Television crews had begun camping out the day before, speaking with people
            who’d tell their stories of why they were there, who they’d lost, how far they’d travelled to see. To meet.
            To share. To mourn.<br /><br />A hiss started in the back, a din rising as the workers tried to make their
            way through the crowd with their tools. Then, about two-thirds of the way through, one of the workers
            stumbled, knocking over a photo in a frame, shattering the glass and tearing the photo inside.<br /><br />The
            man the worker had stepped around shouted, “NO!” and put his arm around his partner as they both began to
            weep.<br /><br />The crowd, squeezing in tight, had turned and was now facing the workers. Wanting to avoid
            an altercation, the workers apologised and began backing away. Then one stopped and reached into his pocket,
            taking out a wallet. He removed a photo and set it among a nearby collection. Nodding at a family next to
            him, he turned back to face the statue, his eyes red.<br /><br />Jules’ own parents had made the pilgrimage
            down to the site. Her twin sister had been killed 6 months prior when hit by a car while riding her bike.
            Jules herself had been injured in the accident and had only recently returned home from the hospital. The
            community had been complaining for years about how dangerous the road was and the lack of space for
            pedestrians and for children to play. Yet not even the death of Jules’ sister had seemed to be enough to
            spur action.<br /><br /><br />The city government realised after the failed removal attempt that destroying
            the statue and memorials would make for bad optics, particularly with an election weeks away. During a visit
            to the site, the mayor, flanked by council members, announced that the statue would not be destroyed, but
            rather would stay through the end of the year before being transferred to another location.<br /><br />Instead
            of being greeted with gratitude, however, the mourners met the mayor with unmoved stares. Looking back to
            the city council members for help, the mayor fumbled with more platitudes as the crowd grew agitated and
            began inching towards them. Some began to chant. The mayor and council members hurriedly returned to their
            cars.<br /><br />In the following weeks, similar memorials began popping up in towns and cities around the
            country, eventually spreading across the globe. Climate change, pollution, and unlivable cities, it had
            touched every community throughout the world. Every family, it seemed, had some connection: a home lost, an
            illness developed—a dangerous road.<br /><br />A death.<br /><br />Something fundamental had changed. An
            insistence that matters must be studied further, assurances that a future technology would save humanity,
            assertions that the needs of the economy had to be balanced against any changes required, these empty
            phrases were no longer met with a shrug.<br /><br />The world couldn’t wait. The matters had been studied.
            The changes needed were themselves the needs of the economy.<br /><br />It was only now, in sight of the
            statues and personal memorials, that the scale of the pain and fear and suffering had become apparent. What
            had been unspoken, what had been private grief, was now shared in the open, one’s own personal tragedy
            interlocked with everyone else’s.<br /><br />Governments began to commit themselves to fund a full transfer
            to renewable forms of energy. In the following year, a series of emergency meetings were convened and a
            global carbon tax was announced. Subsidies for fossil fuels were effectively prohibited.<br /><br />Cities
            around the world drew up plans to redesign them for life, not merely for commerce. Trees. Bike lanes.
            Walking paths. Community gardens. Mutual aid organisations sprang up where governments were too slow to take
            action.<br /><br />In the nearly twenty years since, those initial moments of shared grief had come to be
            seen as the inflection point. Not a single big wake-up call, but rather a cacophony of individual alarms
            that cried out in unison, shaking society’s foundations and moving people to create change.<br /><br />There
            were still countless problems to be solved and much work to be done, but the progress since that time was
            undeniable.<br /><br />Jules climbed between the hunks of metal and sat down alongside the statute of the
            girl. Taking a sip of her coffee, she looked out across the snow-dusted grass to a tree. A squirrel ran down
            its trunk and began digging, looking for a nut it had buried.<br /><br />Jules felt a drop of water land on
            the back of her neck. Turning, she looked up at the girl’s face. The sun had risen higher now, and the
            icicle had begun to melt.<br /><br />She fumbled in her coat pocket and pulled out a small chocolate.<br /><br />“Coconut
            and almond,” she said. “Sorry, it’s all that was left. I’ll pick up a new box after work. You can have one
            of the ones with caramel filling tomorrow.”<br /><br />She unwrapped the chocolate and placed it at the
            girl’s feet.<br /><br />Glancing back over the grass, she saw the squirrel carrying a nut back to the tree,
            having found its store of food.<br /><br />Jules stood up and touched the girl’s upraised palm, lingering
            momentarily before walking back to her bike. Swinging one leg over, she turned around and smiled, saying,
            “Bye, Maggie. See you again tomorrow—same time, same place?”<br /><br />The sound of bicycle bells signalled
            that other riders had begun to make their way through the park. Jules pushed forward, the cold air
            invigorating her.<br /><br />The sun emerged from behind a cloud and took its place in a blue ocean of sky.

            The child’s face was cold, with a coating of frost and an icicle hanging off the end of her chin.<br /><br />The
            sun glinted off her forehead in fits and starts as it peeked through the clouds, but it was too little to
            warm her.<br /><br />It was January, after all, and it had been a cloudy winter.<br /><br />Jules always cut
            through the park on her way to work, but she liked it best this time of year. She liked the way the sun made
            the patches of snow seem to be illuminated from below in the early morning burst of colour. She liked the
            way her breath misted out and up into the sky, a sign of life in the still and frozen world. Few people were
            out walking, meaning she had it more or less to herself.<br /><br />The centrepiece of the park was the
            statue. The statue of the little girl. Violent hunks of metal jutting out in different directions as if it
            had burst through the ground, as if the earth itself had lashed out in anger.<br /><br /><br />And in the
            middle: the girl. The girl with the pleading look and the outstretched hand begging for it to stop. It. All
            of it.<br /><br />The statue had been installed in the dark of night nearly two decades earlier, placed by a
            group of parents who’d lost children. Lost them to floods. Lost them to fires. Lost them to asthma attacks.
            Lost them to bad water, bad storms, bad drivers who didn’t see the children playing.<br /><br />Lost them to
            the rush of society, unwilling to pause, to stop, to see what it was doing.<br /><br />The authorities said
            they’d remove it by the end of the week.<br /><br />But then people started coming.<br /><br />The first one
            came around lunchtime, leaving a photo of her son, age 5. He’d been swept away in the floodwaters following
            a hurricane a couple of years earlier. Later, another, bringing flowers and a child’s teddy. Then more. And
            more.<br /><br />There was the old man who left a photo of a family of five and a bulbous piece of mangled
            glass and stone. He’d lost his son, daughter-in-law, and three grandchildren when fires swept through their
            town out west. They’d been in their car trying to escape when the fires suddenly changed direction and
            overtook them. The glass was all that was left, the melted remains of an ornament he’d given them for the
            dashboard of their car. Something for them to remember him by, and which now served to remind him of
            them.<br /><br />He’d come when he saw the memorial on the news. As did so many others.<br /><br />When city
            workers finally arrived to remove the statue three days later, the crowd had grown, as had the remembrances.
            Photos, flowers, toys, cards, young and old, they all stretched out from the statue in a swirl of grief.
            Assembly and assemblage, alone and together.<br /><br />Jules had been a little girl, just 4 at the time,
            but she remembered the moment. Television crews had begun camping out the day before, speaking with people
            who’d tell their stories of why they were there, who they’d lost, how far they’d travelled to see. To meet.
            To share. To mourn.<br /><br />A hiss started in the back, a din rising as the workers tried to make their
            way through the crowd with their tools. Then, about two-thirds of the way through, one of the workers
            stumbled, knocking over a photo in a frame, shattering the glass and tearing the photo inside.<br /><br />The
            man the worker had stepped around shouted, “NO!” and put his arm around his partner as they both began to
            weep.<br /><br />The crowd, squeezing in tight, had turned and was now facing the workers. Wanting to avoid
            an altercation, the workers apologised and began backing away. Then one stopped and reached into his pocket,
            taking out a wallet. He removed a photo and set it among a nearby collection. Nodding at a family next to
            him, he turned back to face the statue, his eyes red.<br /><br />Jules’ own parents had made the pilgrimage
            down to the site. Her twin sister had been killed 6 months prior when hit by a car while riding her bike.
            Jules herself had been injured in the accident and had only recently returned home from the hospital. The
            community had been complaining for years about how dangerous the road was and the lack of space for
            pedestrians and for children to play. Yet not even the death of Jules’ sister had seemed to be enough to
            spur action.<br /><br /><br />The city government realised after the failed removal attempt that destroying
            the statue and memorials would make for bad optics, particularly with an election weeks away. During a visit
            to the site, the mayor, flanked by council members, announced that the statue would not be destroyed, but
            rather would stay through the end of the year before being transferred to another location.<br /><br />Instead
            of being greeted with gratitude, however, the mourners met the mayor with unmoved stares. Looking back to
            the city council members for help, the mayor fumbled with more platitudes as the crowd grew agitated and
            began inching towards them. Some began to chant. The mayor and council members hurriedly returned to their
            cars.<br /><br />In the following weeks, similar memorials began popping up in towns and cities around the
            country, eventually spreading across the globe. Climate change, pollution, and unlivable cities, it had
            touched every community throughout the world. Every family, it seemed, had some connection: a home lost, an
            illness developed—a dangerous road.<br /><br />A death.<br /><br />Something fundamental had changed. An
            insistence that matters must be studied further, assurances that a future technology would save humanity,
            assertions that the needs of the economy had to be balanced against any changes required, these empty
            phrases were no longer met with a shrug.<br /><br />The world couldn’t wait. The matters had been studied.
            The changes needed were themselves the needs of the economy.<br /><br />It was only now, in sight of the
            statues and personal memorials, that the scale of the pain and fear and suffering had become apparent. What
            had been unspoken, what had been private grief, was now shared in the open, one’s own personal tragedy
            interlocked with everyone else’s.<br /><br />Governments began to commit themselves to fund a full transfer
            to renewable forms of energy. In the following year, a series of emergency meetings were convened and a
            global carbon tax was announced. Subsidies for fossil fuels were effectively prohibited.<br /><br />Cities
            around the world drew up plans to redesign them for life, not merely for commerce. Trees. Bike lanes.
            Walking paths. Community gardens. Mutual aid organisations sprang up where governments were too slow to take
            action.<br /><br />In the nearly twenty years since, those initial moments of shared grief had come to be
            seen as the inflection point. Not a single big wake-up call, but rather a cacophony of individual alarms
            that cried out in unison, shaking society’s foundations and moving people to create change.<br /><br />There
            were still countless problems to be solved and much work to be done, but the progress since that time was
            undeniable.<br /><br />Jules climbed between the hunks of metal and sat down alongside the statute of the
            girl. Taking a sip of her coffee, she looked out across the snow-dusted grass to a tree. A squirrel ran down
            its trunk and began digging, looking for a nut it had buried.<br /><br />Jules felt a drop of water land on
            the back of her neck. Turning, she looked up at the girl’s face. The sun had risen higher now, and the
            icicle had begun to melt.<br /><br />She fumbled in her coat pocket and pulled out a small chocolate.<br /><br />“Coconut
            and almond,” she said. “Sorry, it’s all that was left. I’ll pick up a new box after work. You can have one
            of the ones with caramel filling tomorrow.”<br /><br />She unwrapped the chocolate and placed it at the
            girl’s feet.<br /><br />Glancing back over the grass, she saw the squirrel carrying a nut back to the tree,
            having found its store of food.<br /><br />Jules stood up and touched the girl’s upraised palm, lingering
            momentarily before walking back to her bike. Swinging one leg over, she turned around and smiled, saying,
            “Bye, Maggie. See you again tomorrow—same time, same place?”<br /><br />The sound of bicycle bells signalled
            that other riders had begun to make their way through the park. Jules pushed forward, the cold air
            invigorating her.<br /><br />The sun emerged from behind a cloud and took its place in a blue ocean of sky.
