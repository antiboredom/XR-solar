      <description>A genre of art and literature that envisions a future in which humanity, nature, and technology co-exist in harmony. Solarpunk’s main ethos lies in finding solutions for a more sustainable and egalitarian world through rebellion against the status quo.
Conversations around the climate and ecological emergency often centre on sacrifices needed to avoid a terrible future. Whilst fear can provide motivation for change, it may also lead to paralysis and despondency.</description>

      <description>The XR Wordsmiths Solarpunk Storytelling Showcase is Extinction Rebellion’s first global short story contest for all ages.
The project rides the wave of the Solarpunk movement and aims to use the power of collective imagination as a tool against the climate and ecological emergency. Through radical re-imaginings of the world, we can get closer to creating a future that is positive and healthy for all life.
2021’s Showcase was this project’s first iteration.</description>

      <description>We are a band/collective of writers who are deeply concerned with the climate and ecological emergency facing us all. We are a part of Extinction Rebellion, and hail from all over the world.
Our writing is one way we battle against this emergency— we hope it spurs curiosity, concern, inspiration, reflection, love, rage, and also action.
Check out the XR Wordsmiths blog, where you’ll find all kinds of writing and a diversity of voices and styles, to remind us of the diversity of humankind and our beautiful living earth.</description>
