            A genre of art and literature that envisions a future in which humanity, nature, and technology co-exist in
            harmony. Solarpunk’s main ethos lies in finding solutions for a more sustainable and egalitarian world
            through rebellion against the status quo.<br /><br />Conversations around the climate and ecological

            prefigurative element within Solarpunk takes it beyond fantasy and fiction. What prefiguration means is

            many of its central themes - a green, infinite source of power, freely available to everyone. Inclusivity
            and equality are prominent strands within the Solarpunk vision, along with rejection of unsustainable

            the land of Wakanda in Marvel’s Black Panther. However, a key point is that it’s also about what we do in
            the here and now. Anyone can be part of the Solarpunk movement today, through activities such as sourcing
            clothing sustainably or rewilding our garden - it’s simply about exploring ways of living in greater harmony
