            Ellen studied English at university and has been a primary school teacher in London for 5 years. She is
            currently teaching Year 5 at a school in Bethnal Green. Every day, she sees how much anxiety about climate
            change affects the children she is working with. She also gets to see just how creatively these children
            solve problems and look for alternative versions of the future. Over the course of this competition, it has
            been wonderful to see some of those visions come to life in writing.

            Gregg Kleiner is the author of the novel Where River Turns to Sky (HarperCollins), and a finalist for both
            the Paterson Fiction Prize and the Oregon Book Award (which was optioned for a feature film by FOX
            Searchlight). He has worked as a wildlife biologist, journalist, and dairy goat farmer, and his writing has
            appeared in Orion, The Sun, The Saturday Evening Post, terrain, Whitefish Review, and elsewhere. His first
            book for kids (and their grownups), Please Don’t Paint Our Planet Pink, asks what might happen if we could
            see CO2 in the atmosphere… as pink!<br /><br />He believes that if we’re going to have any chance of slowing
            the climate crisis, we must immediately change the way humanity does almost everything - from consuming far
            less and rebuilding a sense of true community, to respecting all life and listening to the wisdom of
            Indigenous Peoples and the elders among us. The climate work currently underway worldwide by young people
            gives him hope.

            (who aim to help scientists with their activism and activists with their science) since 2018. After
            completing a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics, she started working as a mechanical engineer, building computer

            Dr. Lovis Geier is an ecologist who loves to incorporate her nerdiness into her works of eco-fantasy and
            vice versa, incorporating storytelling and fiction into her science communication work. In her academic
            life, she focuses on population ecology, dispersal, and animal movement in the marine environment - all in
            front of a laptop because she works in silica, meaning building computer models to do all kinds of fancy
            things. Her writing life is mostly lived on her YouTube channel Ecofictology, where she talks all about
            reading and writing eco-fiction and how it can be used as a science communication tool. She hopes to
            continue bridging these two worlds as she tries to find a way to bring her science to the widest audience
            possible.
