“Where are they?” asked Blue, transferring into the cockpit. “How worried are we?”

“They’re post-nuclear, pre-Universal,” replied Grey, projecting a zoomed-in view of the industrial complexes which studded the blue/beige planet they were orbiting.

Blue performed the guttural vibrations which in their culture meant frustration, and complained: “Just once, I’d like to find a people we can talk with who don’t yet have the means and inclination to incinerate everything.”

Blue and Grey’s vessel was literally light-years more advanced than the nuclear-powered rockets of the civilisation they were observing. The aliens below them could hardly reach the edge of their own solar system in the span of one of their lifetimes, let alone visit others. Still, the pulse from a nuclear detonation was quite sufficient to interrupt their zero-point gravity drive, and the only thing worse than crashing into an alien planet was crashing into a freshly-grown radioactive hellscape.

“No need to worry,” replied Grey, “it’s been a while since they shot at anyone.” “At least they have radio,” said Blue, tuning in to the frequencies.
