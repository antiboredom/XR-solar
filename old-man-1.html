          <div class="it-had-been crimsontext-normal-black-39px">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been years since the bird heard the last trucks,
            saws, and men cutting down the trees,&nbsp;&nbsp;killing its friends, and destroying its home. The colorful
            bird was singing on its tree, waiting for the Old Man to tell him stories. The Old Man told him about men’s
            cities: lush forests of blue, green, and gold, far away from the bird’s home. The stories were so different
            from the tales of the bird’s grandfather, who told him about dark, grey places of fear and
            misery.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />He was happy. The Old Man was here. The Old Man always talked to the
            bird,&nbsp;&nbsp;sometimes to the trees of the forest. He thought they did not understand him, for they did
            not&nbsp;&nbsp;share a language. He had always said, in the old times, ‘Birds scream at the top of their
            lungs in horrified hellish rage every morning at daybreak to warn us all of the truth, but sadly we don’t
            speak bird.’&nbsp;&nbsp;Little did he know, the little bird, and the forest, understood the Old Man. They
            were good friends, but unable to share their experiences.<br />One day, the bird decided to see the world
            for himself. It would be a long and tedious&nbsp;&nbsp;journey, but the bird was hopeful about it. He first
            went to see the Old Man to ask him for advice.<br /><br />‘I’m going out of the forest to see the world’
            tweeted the bird.<br /><br />The Old Man answered, not understanding him: ‘Hello little bird, ready to go
            out and explore the wide world on your own I see. You’ll see, it is beautiful, now that we, humans beings,
            have finally made peace with Mother Nature. No more plastics, toxic chemicals, pesticides, or grey fumes
            coming from fossil fuel powerplants. No more overexploitation, no more greed driving us to destroy Earth’s
            treasures. Now, green cities with the bluest skies. Families in gardens, adults reconciling with the nature
            they once feared. Kindness, compassion, and service are&nbsp;&nbsp;universally accepted and expected. I hope
            you’ll find some friends during your journey. Farewell, little bird.’<br /><br />
            Little did they understand each other, but the bird could tell that the Old Man was happy to see him. And
            maybe a little sad at the same time.<br /><br />‘Don’t worry’ said the bird, ‘I’ll be back soon.’<br /><br />The
            Old Man let a tear roll down his cheek.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The bird flew across emeralds seas and sapphire
            skies, across mountain tops kissed&nbsp;&nbsp;with snow. He flew across deserts of golden sands and blue
            waters of tranquility. The bird&nbsp;&nbsp;learned that the world was a beautiful but fragile place, as the
            Earth showed him the scars man left on her. He flew through rains, storms, sandstorms, and even blizzards
            (the accelerated forces of natural selection had made him a very tough bird, almost a super bird) and
            learned that no matter how dark the sky could be at night, the day would eventually come. No matter how the
            sky was filled with black clouds of grey lighting, sandstorms, or freezing ice, the sun would shine again.
            Yes, the little bird learned that hope would exist as long as that beautiful yet fragile world would. He
            learned that preserving that beauty was the only way to preserve hope. And he was glad that the friends of
            the Old Man had helped preserve his forest.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />A few weeks later, the bird arrived at his
            first human settlement. (He explored the wilderness for some time, even though the city was only a few hours
            away). Strangely, he almost mistook the city for some alien forest, all green and blue. It wasn’t the cities
            his grandfather told him about. It was merrier, greener, quieter. There, the bird met a young puppy, with
            white fur.<br /><br />‘Hello, puppy’” he said. The non-humans animals could understand each other, while
            humans animals had lost that ability since they walked away from harmony with Mother&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature.<br /><br />‘Hello,
            bird.’<br /><br />‘I’ve never seen a colorful bird like you before,’ said the dog. ‘Who are you?’<br /><br />‘My
            friend, call me Birdie,’&nbsp;&nbsp;responded the Bird. ‘You’re my friend right?’<br /><br />‘I could use
            one,” said the dog. ‘My name is Wouf’<br /><br />‘Have you ever been outside the City’” Asked the bird.<br /><br />‘I
            haven’t, I am still a young puppy and I have been told that outside my comfort zone (the couch) is a
            dangerous place to be.’<br /><br />‘Everybody says that Wouf; until they realize that it&nbsp;&nbsp;is not a
            very dangerous place to be but an exciting one.’<br /><br />‘If you say so. You come from a faraway place,
            after all, you must know what you’re talking about.’ said the dog.<br /><br />‘Well. sometimes I do.
            Sometimes, I don’t. Would you like to explore the outskirts of the city with me?’<br /><br />
            ‘I’d love to, my flying friend.’&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birdie and Wouf started their
            journey exploring the city’s wild outskirts. They went to the hills, through flowers and encountered a few
            unfamilar species of insect (that Birdie ate).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hours after the sun
            was set, they found a young couple on the sweet green grass. The pair talked about the stars and how they
            were beautiful. They talked about the Earth, about love, friendship, and all those marvelous things you can
            feel yet not see. They laughed a lot and finally fell asleep in each other’s arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog, who
            understood man’s language offered to translate what the young human couple said to the bird.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
            the morning, the bird gently tweeted and the dog woofed softly as the sound of the hills woke the young duo.
            They saw the bird and the dog.<br /><br />‘He is so cute,’ said the boy. He loved dogs. The girl rather
            liked the bird. Maybe they had something to teach them.<br /><br />‘Hello bird, hello dog,’ said the girl.
            ‘My name is Lia and here’s my boyfriend, Peter.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog translated for
            the little bird, but he already knew, of course, that the boy and the girl were together. Love was
            universal.<br /><br />‘I’m Wouf and this is my friend, Birdie.’ replied the dog, pointing his muzzle toward
            the flying creature. The boy who liked dogs understood Wouf, and they all became friends and made friendship
            bracelets. Because that’s what friends do.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bird asked the humans if
            they wanted to explore the world with him. They told him they’d be glad to go with him. They packed their
            bags full of what they called ‘green equitable tech’ - solar-powered cameras, field recorders, and other
            devices that would enable them to record what they saw and heard on their journey. Soon enough, the little
            group went out in the wild, explored ancient and forgotten cities, and met new people, animals, and ideas.
            The young couple became married and adopted the dog (who was free to come and go out of the house as he
            pleased) and lived a happy life. Meanwhile, the bird learned to talk to the trees.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            A few years later, they saw each other at the&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Man’s funeral. They were sad and cried a lot,
            but were happy too, for his body was to become part of the Earth again. During the funeral, there were
            almost as many non-human animals as they were humans.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time
            in many years, the bird experienced sadness. Wouf grew older, faster than Birdie. The man, Peter (who was
            not young anymore, except in his head) learned the bird’s language, (he was terrible at it, but he tried)
            for he knew that when the dog eventually passed away, they would not be able to share their experiences.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
            Wouf lived longer than anyone could hope.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bird eventually found happiness again. They all
            went on a trip to see the wonderful world once more. This time around, they were able to take a shuttle to
            see it from above. It was magical and at this moment, like all astronauts that came before them, they
            understood how this world was their responsibility and how beautiful and fragile it was. Like hope. They all
            thought that they must take care of it, for the dog while he was there, and all the dogs that would come
            after him. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Wouf’s death, the bird went back to the forest to talk to the
            trees and to die in peace. (He was very old when Wouf died). He knew that Peter’s children would take care
            of the forest,&nbsp;&nbsp;like their parents and the Old Man before them. Birdie was glad he had the chance
            to travel the world and tell his story to all the birds in the forest. And now that his story was over, it
            was time for someone else to take his place, so the story of hope would live in the hearts of all living
            inhabitants of Earth.

            Little did they understand each other, but the bird could tell that the Old Man was happy to see him. And
            maybe a little sad at the same time.<br /><br />‘Don’t worry’ said the bird, ‘I’ll be back soon.’<br /><br />The

            A few years later, they saw each other at the&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Man’s funeral. They were sad and cried a lot,
            but were happy too, for his body was to become part of the Earth again. During the funeral, there were
            almost as many non-human animals as they were humans.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time
            in many years, the bird experienced sadness. Wouf grew older, faster than Birdie. The man, Peter (who was
            not young anymore, except in his head) learned the bird’s language, (he was terrible at it, but he tried)
            for he knew that when the dog eventually passed away, they would not be able to share their experiences.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
            Wouf lived longer than anyone could hope.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bird eventually found happiness again. They all
            went on a trip to see the wonderful world once more. This time around, they were able to take a shuttle to
            see it from above. It was magical and at this moment, like all astronauts that came before them, they
            understood how this world was their responsibility and how beautiful and fragile it was. Like hope. They all
            thought that they must take care of it, for the dog while he was there, and all the dogs that would come
            after him. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Wouf’s death, the bird went back to the forest to talk to the
            trees and to die in peace. (He was very old when Wouf died). He knew that Peter’s children would take care
            of the forest,&nbsp;&nbsp;like their parents and the Old Man before them. Birdie was glad he had the chance
            to travel the world and tell his story to all the birds in the forest. And now that his story was over, it
            was time for someone else to take his place, so the story of hope would live in the hearts of all living
            inhabitants of Earth.

          <div class="it-had-been-2 crimsontext-normal-black-19px">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been years since the bird heard the last trucks,
            saws, and men cutting down the trees,&nbsp;&nbsp;killing its friends, and destroying its home. The colorful
            bird was singing on its tree, waiting for the Old Man to tell him stories. The Old Man told him about men’s
            cities: lush forests of blue, green, and gold, far away from the bird’s home. The stories were so different
            from the tales of the bird’s grandfather, who told him about dark, grey places of fear and
            misery.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />He was happy. The Old Man was here. The Old Man always talked to the
            bird,&nbsp;&nbsp;sometimes to the trees of the forest. He thought they did not understand him, for they did
            not&nbsp;&nbsp;share a language. He had always said, in the old times, ‘Birds scream at the top of their
            lungs in horrified hellish rage every morning at daybreak to warn us all of the truth, but sadly we don’t
            speak bird.’&nbsp;&nbsp;Little did he know, the little bird, and the forest, understood the Old Man. They
            were good friends, but unable to share their experiences.<br />One day, the bird decided to see the world
            for himself. It would be a long and tedious&nbsp;&nbsp;journey, but the bird was hopeful about it. He first
            went to see the Old Man to ask him for advice.<br /><br />‘I’m going out of the forest to see the world’
            tweeted the bird.<br /><br />The Old Man answered, not understanding him: ‘Hello little bird, ready to go
            out and explore the wide world on your own I see. You’ll see, it is beautiful, now that we, humans beings,
            have finally made peace with Mother Nature. No more plastics, toxic chemicals, pesticides, or grey fumes
            coming from fossil fuel powerplants. No more overexploitation, no more greed driving us to destroy Earth’s
            treasures. Now, green cities with the bluest skies. Families in gardens, adults reconciling with the nature
            they once feared. Kindness, compassion, and service are&nbsp;&nbsp;universally accepted and expected. I hope
            you’ll find some friends during your journey. Farewell, little bird.’<br /><br />
            Little did they understand each other, but the bird could tell that the Old Man was happy to see him. And
            maybe a little sad at the same time.<br /><br />‘Don’t worry’ said the bird, ‘I’ll be back soon.’<br /><br />The
            Old Man let a tear roll down his cheek.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The bird flew across emeralds seas and sapphire
            skies, across mountain tops kissed&nbsp;&nbsp;with snow. He flew across deserts of golden sands and blue
            waters of tranquility. The bird&nbsp;&nbsp;learned that the world was a beautiful but fragile place, as the
            Earth showed him the scars man left on her. He flew through rains, storms, sandstorms, and even blizzards
            (the accelerated forces of natural selection had made him a very tough bird, almost a super bird) and
            learned that no matter how dark the sky could be at night, the day would eventually come. No matter how the
            sky was filled with black clouds of grey lighting, sandstorms, or freezing ice, the sun would shine again.
            Yes, the little bird learned that hope would exist as long as that beautiful yet fragile world would. He
            learned that preserving that beauty was the only way to preserve hope. And he was glad that the friends of
            the Old Man had helped preserve his forest.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />A few weeks later, the bird arrived at his
            first human settlement. (He explored the wilderness for some time, even though the city was only a few hours
            away). Strangely, he almost mistook the city for some alien forest, all green and blue. It wasn’t the cities
            his grandfather told him about. It was merrier, greener, quieter. There, the bird met a young puppy, with
            white fur.<br /><br />‘Hello, puppy’” he said. The non-humans animals could understand each other, while
            humans animals had lost that ability since they walked away from harmony with Mother&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature.<br /><br />‘Hello,
            bird.’<br /><br />‘I’ve never seen a colorful bird like you before,’ said the dog. ‘Who are you?’<br /><br />‘My
            friend, call me Birdie,’&nbsp;&nbsp;responded the Bird. ‘You’re my friend right?’<br /><br />‘I could use
            one,” said the dog. ‘My name is Wouf’<br /><br />‘Have you ever been outside the City’” Asked the bird.<br /><br />‘I
            haven’t, I am still a young puppy and I have been told that outside my comfort zone (the couch) is a
            dangerous place to be.’<br /><br />‘Everybody says that Wouf; until they realize that it&nbsp;&nbsp;is not a
            very dangerous place to be but an exciting one.’<br /><br />‘If you say so. You come from a faraway place,
            after all, you must know what you’re talking about.’ said the dog.<br /><br />‘Well. sometimes I do.
            Sometimes, I don’t. Would you like to explore the outskirts of the city with me?’<br /><br />
            ‘I’d love to, my flying friend.’&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birdie and Wouf started their
            journey exploring the city’s wild outskirts. They went to the hills, through flowers and encountered a few
            unfamilar species of insect (that Birdie ate).<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hours after the sun
            was set, they found a young couple on the sweet green grass. The pair talked about the stars and how they
            were beautiful. They talked about the Earth, about love, friendship, and all those marvelous things you can
            feel yet not see. They laughed a lot and finally fell asleep in each other’s arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog, who
            understood man’s language offered to translate what the young human couple said to the bird.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
            the morning, the bird gently tweeted and the dog woofed softly as the sound of the hills woke the young duo.
            They saw the bird and the dog.<br /><br />‘He is so cute,’ said the boy. He loved dogs. The girl rather
            liked the bird. Maybe they had something to teach them.<br /><br />‘Hello bird, hello dog,’ said the girl.
            ‘My name is Lia and here’s my boyfriend, Peter.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog translated for
            the little bird, but he already knew, of course, that the boy and the girl were together. Love was
            universal.<br /><br />‘I’m Wouf and this is my friend, Birdie.’ replied the dog, pointing his muzzle toward
            the flying creature. The boy who liked dogs understood Wouf, and they all became friends and made friendship
            bracelets. Because that’s what friends do.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bird asked the humans if
            they wanted to explore the world with him. They told him they’d be glad to go with him. They packed their
            bags full of what they called ‘green equitable tech’ - solar-powered cameras, field recorders, and other
            devices that would enable them to record what they saw and heard on their journey. Soon enough, the little
            group went out in the wild, explored ancient and forgotten cities, and met new people, animals, and ideas.
            The young couple became married and adopted the dog (who was free to come and go out of the house as he
            pleased) and lived a happy life. Meanwhile, the bird learned to talk to the trees.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            A few years later, they saw each other at the&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Man’s funeral. They were sad and cried a lot,
            but were happy too, for his body was to become part of the Earth again. During the funeral, there were
            almost as many non-human animals as they were humans.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time
